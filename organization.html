<p>W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. W3C <a href=
"#Members">Member</a> organizations provide resources to this end, and the W3C
<a href="#Team">Team</a> provides the technical leadership and organization to
coordinate the effort.</p>
<h3>2.1 <a name="Members" id="Members">Members</a></h3>
<p>W3C Members are primarily represented in W3C processes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a> is composed of one representative
from each Member organization (refer to the <a href=
"comm.html#Member-only">Member-only</a> list of <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Member/ACList">current Advisory Committee
representatives</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-current-ac">MEM1</a>]). The
Advisory Committee:
<ul>
<li>reviews plans for W3C at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
meeting</a>;</li>
<li>reviews formal proposals from the W3C Director: <a href=
"activities.html#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposals</a>, <a href=
"tr.html#RecsPR">Proposed Recommendations</a>, and <a href=
"processdoc.html#GAProcess">Proposed Process Documents</a>.</li>
<li>elects the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a> participants other than the
Advisory Board Chair.</li>
<li>elects 5 of the 9 participants on the <a href="#TAG">Technical Architecture
Group</a>.</li>
</ul>
Advisory Committee representatives have <a href=
"acreview.html#ACAppeal">appeal</a> powers for some processes described in this
document.</li>
<li>Representatives of Member organizations participate in <a href=
"groups.html#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination
Groups</a> and author and review <a href="#Recs">technical reports</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="MemberSubscription" id="MemberSubscription">W3C membership</a> is
open to all entities, as described in "<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">How to Join W3C</a>" [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]; (refer to the public list of <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List">current W3C Members</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-current-mem">PUB8</a>]). Organizations subscribe according to
the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
Agreement</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-member-agreement">PUB6</a>]. The <a href=
"#Team">Team</a> <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> ensure that Member
participation agreements remain <a href="comm.html#Team-only">Team-only</a> and
that no Member receives preferential treatment within W3C.</p>
<p><a name="IndividualParticipation" id="IndividualParticipation">W3C does not
have a class of membership tailored to, or priced for individuals</a>. However,
an individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> join W3C as an Affiliate Member.
In this case the same restrictions pertaining to <a href=
"#MemberRelated">related Members</a> apply when the individual also <a href=
"policies.html#member-rep">represents</a> another W3C Member.</p>
<h4>2.1.1 <a name="MemberBenefits" id="MemberBenefits">Rights of
Members</a></h4>
<p>Each Member organization enjoys the following rights and benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>A seat on the <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>;</li>
<li>Access to <a href="comm.html#Member-only">Member-only</a> information;</li>
<li>The <a href="submission.html#Submission">Member Submission</a>
process;</li>
<li>Use of the W3C Member logo on promotional material and to publicize the
Member's participation in W3C. For more information, please refer to the Member
logo usage policy described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
Member Orientation</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, representatives of Member organizations participate in W3C as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="groups.html#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and
Coordination Groups</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="events.html#GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a>;</li>
<li>On the Team, as <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellows</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case (described in paragraph 5g of the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
Agreement</a>), where a Member organization is itself a consortium, user
society, or otherwise has members or sponsors, the organization's paid staff
and Advisory Committee representative exercise all the rights and privileges of
W3C membership. In addition, the Advisory Committee representative <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> designate up to four (or more at the Team's discretion)
individuals who, though not employed by the organization, <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> exercise the rights of <a href=
"policies.html#member-rep">Member representatives</a>. These individuals
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose their employment affiliation when
participating in W3C work. Provisions for <a href="#MemberRelated">related
Members</a> apply. Furthermore, these individuals are expected to represent the
broad interests of the W3C Member organization and not the parochial interests
of their employers.</p>
<p>The rights and benefits of W3C membership are contingent upon conformance to
the processes described in this document. The vast majority of W3C Members
faithfully follow the spirit as well as the letter of these processes. When
serious and/or repeated violations do occur, and repeated attempts to address
these violations have not resolved the situation, the Director <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> take disciplinary action. Arbitration in the case of
further disagreement is governed by paragraph 19 of the Membership Agreement.
Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/09/discipline">Guidelines for
Disciplinary Action</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-discipline-gl">MEM14</a>].</p>
<h4>2.1.2 <a name="MemberRelated" id="MemberRelated">Related Members</a></h4>
<p>In the interest of ensuring the integrity of the consensus process, Member
involvement in some of the processes in this document is affected by related
Member status. As used herein, two Members are related if:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either Member is a subsidiary of the other, or</li>
<li>Both Members are subsidiaries of a common entity, or</li>
<li>The Members have an employment contract or consulting contract that affects
W3C participation.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>subsidiary</em> is an organization of which effective control and/or
majority ownership rests with another, single organization.</p>
<p>Related Members <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose these
relationships according to the mechanisms described in the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</p>
<h4>2.1.3 <a name="AC" id="AC">Advisory Committee (AC)</a></h4>
<p>When an organization joins W3C (see "<a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">How to Join W3C</a>" [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]), it <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> name
its Advisory Committee representative as part of the Membership Agreement. The
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a> explains
how to subscribe or unsubscribe to Advisory Committee mailing lists, provides
information about Advisory Committee meetings, explains how to name a new
Advisory Committee representative, and more. Advisory Committee representatives
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the <a href=
"policies.html#coi">conflict of interest policy</a> by disclosing information
according to the mechanisms described in the New Member Orientation. See also
the additional roles of Advisory Committee representatives described in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
<p>Additional information for Members is available at the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Member/">Member Web site</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-member-web">MEM6</a>].</p>
<h5>2.1.3.1 <a name="ACCommunication" id="ACCommunication">Advisory Committee
Mailing Lists</a></h5>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two mailing lists for use
by the Advisory Committee:</p>
<ol>
<li>One for official announcements (e.g., those required by this document) from
the Team to the Advisory Committee. This list is read-only for Advisory
Committee representatives.</li>
<li>One for discussion among Advisory Committee representatives. Though this
list is primarily for Advisory Committee representatives, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> monitor discussion and <span class=
"rfc2119">SHOULD</span> participate in discussion when appropriate. Ongoing
detailed discussions <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be moved to other
appropriate lists (new or existing, such as a mailing list created for a
<a href="events.html#GAEvents">Workshop</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>An Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
request that additional individuals from their organization be subscribed to
these lists. Failure to contain distribution internally <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> result in suspension of additional email addresses, at the
discretion of the Team.</p>
<h5>2.1.3.2 <a name="ACMeetings" id="ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
Meetings</a></h5>
<p>The Team organizes a <a href="policies.html#ftf-meeting">face-to-face
meeting</a> for the Advisory Committee <span class="time-interval">twice a
year</span>. The Team appoints the Chair of these meetings (generally the
<a href="#def-W3CChair">W3C Chair</a> or <a href="#def-COO">Chief Operating
Officer</a>). At each Advisory Committee meeting, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">SHOULD</span> provide an update to the Advisory Committee about:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>Resources</em></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The number of Full and Affiliate W3C Members.</li>
<li>An overview of the financial status of W3C.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><em>Allocations</em></dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The allocation of the annual budget, including size of the Team and their
approximate deployment.</li>
<li>A list of all Activities and brief status statement about each, in
particular those started or terminated since the previous Advisory Committee
meeting.</li>
<li>The allocation of resources to pursuing <a href=
"liaisons.html#Liaisons">liaisons</a> with other organizations.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each Member organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send one
<a href="policies.html#member-rep">representative</a> to each Advisory
Committee meeting. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., during a period of
transition between representatives from an organization), the meeting Chair
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> allow a Member organization to send two
representatives to a meeting.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the date and location of
each Advisory Committee meeting no later than at the end of the previous
meeting; <span class="time-interval">one year's</span> notice is preferred. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the region of each Advisory
Committee meeting at least <span class="time-interval">one year</span> in
advance.</p>
<p>More information about <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Meeting/">Advisory
Committee meetings</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-ac-meetings">MEM5</a>] is
available at the Member Web site.</p>
<h3>2.2 <a name="Team" id="Team">The W3C Team</a></h3>
<p>The Team consists of the W3C paid staff, unpaid interns, and W3C Fellows.
<a name="fellows" id="fellows">W3C Fellows</a> are Member employees working as
part of the Team; see the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows">W3C Fellows Program</a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-fellows">PUB32</a>]. The Team provides technical
leadership about Web technologies, organizes and manages W3C Activities to
reach goals within practical constraints (such as resources available), and
communicates with the Members and the public about the Web and W3C
technologies.</p>
<p>The Team is led by the Director, W3C Chair, and Chief Operating Officer.
These individuals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> delegate responsibility
(generally to other individuals in the Team) for any of their roles described
in this document.</p>
<p>The <a name="def-Director" id="def-Director">Director</a> is the lead
technical architect at W3C and as such, is responsible for assessing <a name=
"DirectorDecision" href="policies.html#def-Consensus" id=
"DirectorDecision">consensus</a> within W3C for architectural choices,
publication of <a href="tr.html#Reports">technical reports</a>, and new
<a href="activities.html#Activities">Activities</a>. The Director appoints
group <a href="groups.html#GeneralChairs">Chairs</a> and has the role of
"tie-breaker" for questions of <a href="groups.html#good-standing">Good
Standing</a> in a Working Group or <a href="policies.html#WGAppeals">appeal of
a Working Group decision</a>. The Director is generally Chair of the <a href=
"#TAG">TAG</a>.</p>
<p>The <a name="def-W3CChair" id="def-W3CChair">W3C Chair</a> leads Member
relations, and <a href="liaisons.html#Liaisons">liaisons</a> with other
organizations, governments, and the public.</p>
<p>The <a name="def-COO" id="def-COO">Chief Operating Officer</a>
(<acronym>COO</acronym>) leads the operation of W3C as an organization: a
collection of people, <a href="#hosts">Host institutions</a>, and
processes.</p>
<p>Team administrative information such as Team salaries, detailed budgeting,
and other business decisions are <a href="comm.html#Team-only">Team-only</a>,
subject to oversight by the Host institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> W3C is not currently incorporated. For legal
contracts, W3C is represented by three <a name="hosts" id="hosts">"Host"
institutions</a>: the European Research Consortium for Informatics and
Mathematics (<acronym>ERCIM</acronym>), Keio University, and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (<acronym>MIT</acronym>). Within W3C, the Host
institutions are governed by joint sponsorship contracts; the Hosts themselves
are not W3C Members.</p>
<h4>2.2.1 <a name="TeamSubmission" id="TeamSubmission">Team
Submissions</a></h4>
<p>Team members <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> request that the Director
publish information at the W3C Web site. At the Director's discretion, these
documents are published as "Team Submissions". These documents are analogous to
<a href="submission.html#Submission">Member Submissions</a> (e.g., in <a href=
"submission.html#SubmissionScope">expected scope</a>). However, there is no
additional Team comment. The <a href="tr.html#DocumentStatus">document status
section</a> of a Team Submission indicates the level of Team consensus about
the published material.</p>
<p>Team Submissions are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href=
"tr.html#Reports">technical report development process</a>.</p>
<p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/">published Team
Submissions</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-team-submission-list">PUB16</a>] is
available at the W3C Web site.</p>
<h3>2.3 <a name="AB" id="AB">Advisory Board (AB)</a></h3>
<p>Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the
Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict
resolution. The Advisory Board also serves the Members by tracking issues
raised between Advisory Committee meetings, soliciting Member comments on such
issues, and proposing actions to resolve these issues. The Advisory Board
manages the <a href="processdoc.html#GAProcess">evolution of the Process
Document</a>. The Advisory Board hears appeals of <a href=
"submission.html#SubmissionNo">Member Submission requests</a> that are rejected
for reasons unrelated to Web architecture; see also the <a href=
"#TAG">TAG</a>.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board is <strong>not</strong> a board of directors and has no
decision-making authority within W3C; its role is strictly advisory.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available a mailing list for
the Advisory Board to use for its communication, confidential to the Advisory
Board and Team.</p>
<p>The Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of
each of its meetings to the Advisory Committee and other group Chairs. The
Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also report on its
activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>.</p>
<p>Details about the Advisory Board (e.g., the list of Advisory Board
participants, mailing list information, and summaries of Advisory Board
meetings) are available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ab/">Advisory
Board home page</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-ab-home">PUB30</a>].</p>
<h4>2.3.1 <a name="ABParticipation" id="ABParticipation">Advisory Board
Participation</a></h4>
<p>The Advisory Board consists of nine elected participants and a Chair. The
Team appoints the Chair of the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>, who is
generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair">W3C Chair</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining nine Advisory Board participants are elected by the W3C
Advisory Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination
and election process</a>.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all Advisory Board
participants are for <span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are
staggered so that each year, either four or five terms expire. If an individual
is elected to fill an incomplete term, that individual's term ends at the
normal expiration date of that term. Regular Advisory Board terms begin on 1
July and end on 30 June.</p>
<h3>2.4 <a name="TAG" id="TAG">Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a></h3>
<p>Created in February 2001, the mission of the TAG is stewardship of the Web
architecture. There are three aspects to this mission:</p>
<ol>
<li>to document and build consensus around principles of Web architecture and
to interpret and clarify these principles when necessary;</li>
<li>to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the
TAG;</li>
<li>to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and
outside W3C.</li>
</ol>
<p>The TAG hears appeals of <a href="submission.html#SubmissionNo">Member
Submission requests</a> that are rejected for reasons related to Web
architecture; see also the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</p>
<p>The TAG's scope is limited to technical issues about Web architecture. The
TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> consider administrative, process,
or organizational policy issues of W3C, which are generally addressed by the
W3C Advisory Committee, Advisory Board, and Team. Please refer to the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag">TAG charter</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] for more information about the
background and scope of the TAG, and the expected qualifications of TAG
participants.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available two mailing lists
for the TAG:</p>
<ul>
<li>a public discussion (not just input) list for issues of Web architecture.
The TAG will conduct its public business on this list.</li>
<li>a <a href="comm.html#Member-only">Member-only</a> list for discussions
within the TAG and for requests to the TAG that, for whatever reason, cannot be
made on the public list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also request the creation of
additional topic-specific, public mailing lists. For some TAG discussions
(e.g., an appeal of a <a href="submission.html#SubmissionNo">rejected Member
Submission request</a>), the TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use a list
that will be <a href="comm.html#Member-only">Member-only</a>.</p>
<p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of each of its
<a href="policies.html#GeneralMeetings">meetings</a> to the Advisory Committee
and other group Chairs. The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> also report
on its activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
meeting</a>.</p>
<p>When the TAG votes to resolve an issue, each TAG participant (whether
appointed, elected, or the Chair) has one vote; see also the section on
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag#Voting">voting in the TAG charter</a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] and the general section on
<a href="policies.html#Votes">votes</a> in this Process Document.</p>
<p>Details about the TAG (e.g., the list of TAG participants, mailing list
information, and summaries of TAG meetings) are available at the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG home page</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-tag-home">PUB26</a>].</p>
<h4>2.4.1 <a id="tag-participation" name="tag-participation">Technical
Architecture Group Participation</a></h4>
<p>The TAG consists of eight elected or appointed participants and a Chair. The
Team appoints the Chair of the TAG, who is generally the <a href=
"#def-Director">Director</a>.</p>
<p>Three TAG participants are appointed by the Director. Appointees are
<span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be on the W3C Team. The Director
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appoint <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellows</a> to
the TAG.</p>
<p>The remaining five TAG participants are elected by the W3C Advisory
Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination and
election process</a>.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all TAG participants are for
<span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are staggered so that each
year, either two or three elected terms, and either one or two appointed terms
expire. If an individual is appointed or elected to fill an incomplete term,
that individual's term ends at the normal expiration date of that term. Regular
TAG terms begin on 1 February and end on 31 January.</p>
<h3>2.5 <a name="AB-TAG-participation" id="AB-TAG-participation">Advisory Board
and Technical Architecture Group Participation</a></h3>
<p>Advisory Board and TAG participants have a special role within W3C: they are
elected by the Membership and appointed by the Director with the expectation
that they will use their best judgment to find the best solutions for the Web,
not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user. Advisory
Board and TAG participants are expected to participate regularly and fully.
<a href="groups.html#good-standing">Good Standing</a> rules as defined for
Working Group participants also apply to Advisory Board and TAG participants.
Advisory Board and TAG participants <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> attend
<a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meetings</a>.</p>
<p>An individual participates on the Advisory Board or TAG from the moment the
individual's term begins until the term ends or the seat is <a href=
"#AB-TAG-vacated">vacated</a>. Although Advisory Board and TAG participants do
not advocate for the commercial interests of their employers, their
participation does carry the responsibilities associated with Member
representation, Invited Expert status, or Team representation (as described in
the section on the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination and election
process</a>). See also the licensing obligations on TAG participants in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Obligations">section
3</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent
Policy</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>], and the claim
exclusion process of <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Exclusion">section 4</a>.</p>
<h4>2.5.1 <a id="AB-TAG-constraints" name="AB-TAG-constraints">Advisory Board
and Technical Architecture Group Participation Constraints</a></h4>
<p>Given the few seats available on the Advisory Board and the TAG, and in
order to ensure that the diversity of W3C Members is represented:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the TAG.</li>
<li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the AB.</li>
<li>An individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> participate on both the
TAG and the AB.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, for whatever reason, these constraints are not satisfied (e.g., because
a TAG or AB participant changes jobs), one participant <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> cease TAG or AB participation until the situation has
been resolved. If after <span class="time-interval">30 days</span> the
situation has not been resolved, the Chair will declare one participant's seat
to be vacant. When more than one individual is involved, the <a href=
"#random">verifiable random selection procedure</a> described below will be
used to choose one person for continued participation.</p>
<h4>2.5.2 <a id="AB-TAG-elections" name="AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and
Technical Architecture Group Elections</a></h4>
<p>The Advisory Board and a portion of the Technical Architecture Group are
elected by the Advisory Committee. An election begins when the Team sends a
Call for Nominations to the Advisory Committee. Any Call for Nominations
specifies the number of available seats, the deadline for nominations, and the
address where nominations are sent. The Director <span class=
"rfc2119">SHOULD</span> announce appointments no later than the start of a
nomination period, and generally as part of the Call for Nominations.</p>
<p>Each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>)
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> nominate one individual. A nomination
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made with the consent of the nominee. In
order for an individual to be nominated as a Member representative, the
individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> qualify for <a href=
"policies.html#member-rep">Member representation</a> and the Member's Advisory
Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include in the
nomination the (same) <a href="groups.html#member-rep-info">information
required for a Member representative in a Working Group</a>. In order for an
individual to be nominated as an Invited Expert, the individual <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> provide the (same) <a href=
"groups.html#inv-expert-info">information required for an Invited Expert in a
Working Group</a> and the nominating Advisory Committee representative
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include that information in the nomination.
In order for an individual to be nominated as a Team representative, the
nominating Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
first secure approval from Team management. A nominee is <span class=
"rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be an employee of a Member organization, and
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be a <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellow</a>. Each
nomination <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include a few informative
paragraphs about the nominee.</p>
<p>If, after the deadline for nominations, the number of nominees is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal to the number of available seats, those nominees are thereby elected.
This situation constitutes a tie for the purposes of assigning <a href=
"#short-term">short terms</a>.</li>
<li>Less than the number of available seats, Calls for Nominations are issued
until a sufficient number of people have been nominated. Those already
nominated do not need to be renominated after a renewed call.</li>
<li>Greater than the number of available seats, the Team issues a Call for
Votes that includes the names of all candidates, the number of available seats,
the deadline for votes, and the address where votes are sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>When there is a vote, each Member (or group of <a href=
"#MemberRelated">related Members</a>) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote for
as many candidates as there are available seats; see the section on <a href=
"acreview.html#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</a>. Once the deadline for
votes has passed, the Team announces the results to the Advisory Committee. The
candidates with the most votes are elected to the available seats. In case of a
tie where there are more apparent winners than available seats (e.g., three
candidates receive 10 votes each for two seats), the <a href=
"#random">verifiable random selection procedure</a> described below will be
used to fill the available seats.</p>
<p id="short-term">The shortest term is assigned to the elected individual who
received the fewest votes, the next shortest to the elected individual who
received the next fewest, and so on. In the case of a tie among those eligible
for a short term, the <a href="#random">verifiable random selection
procedure</a> described below will be used to assign the short term.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/10/election-howto">How to Organize

<h5>2.5.2.1 <a name="random" id="random">Verifiable Random Selection
Procedure</a></h5>
<p>When it is necessary to use a verifiable random selection process (e.g., in
an AB or TAG election, to "draw straws" in case of a tie or to fill a short
term), W3C uses the random and verifiable procedure defined in <a href=
"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2777.txt">RFC 2777</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-RFC2777">RFC2777</a>]. The procedure orders an input list of
names (listed in alphabetical order by family name unless otherwise specified)
into a "result order."</p>
<p>W3C applies this procedure as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>When N people have tied for M (less than N) seats. In this case, only the
names of the N individuals who tied are provided as input to the procedure. The
M seats are assigned in result order.</li>
<li>After all elected individuals have been identified, when N people are
eligible for M (less than N) short terms. In this case, only the names of those
N individuals are provided as input to the procedure. The short terms are
assigned in result order.</li>
</ol>
<h4>2.5.3 <a id="AB-TAG-vacated" name="AB-TAG-vacated">Advisory Board and
Technical Architecture Group Vacated Seats</a></h4>
<p>An Advisory Board or TAG participant's seat is vacated when either of the
following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>the participant <a href="policies.html#resignation">resigns</a>, or</li>
<li>the Chair asks the participant to <a href=
"policies.html#resignation">resign</a>, for example because the participant has
failed to remain in <a href="groups.html#good-standing">Good Standing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an Advisory Board or TAG participant changes affiliations, as long as
<a href="#AB-TAG-constraints">Advisory Board and TAG participation
constraints</a> are respected, the individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
continue to participate until the next regularly scheduled election for that
group. Otherwise, the seat is vacated.</p>
<p>Vacated seats are filled according to this schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>When an appointed TAG seat is vacated, the Director <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> re-appoint someone immediately, but no later than the next
regularly scheduled election.</li>
<li>When an elected seat on either the AB or TAG is vacated, the seat is filled
at the next regularly scheduled election for the group unless the group Chair
requests that W3C hold an election before then (for instance, due to the
group's workload). The group Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
request an exceptional election if the next regularly scheduled election is
fewer than three months away.</li>
