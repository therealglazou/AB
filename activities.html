<p>This section describes the mechanisms for establishing consensus within the
areas of Web development the Consortium chooses to pursue. An <a name=
"def-Activity" id="def-Activity">Activity</a> organizes the work necessary for
the development or evolution of a Web technology.</p>
<p>W3C starts an Activity based on interest from the Members and Team. W3C
Members build interest around new work through discussions among Advisory
Committee representatives, Chairs, and Team, and through the <a href=
"submission.html#Submission">Submission process</a>. The Team tracks Web
developments inside and outside W3C, manages <a href=
"liaisons.html#Liaisons">liaisons</a>, and organizes <a href=
"events.html#EventsW">Workshops</a>.</p>
<p>Based on input from the Team and Members about the structure and scope of an
Activity, the Team sends an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>
to the Advisory Committee. This is a proposal to dedicate Team and Member
resources to a particular area of Web technology or policy, and when there is
consensus about the motivation, scope, and structure of the proposed work, W3C
starts a new Activity.</p>
<p>Each Activity has its own structure that generally includes Working Groups,
Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups. Within the framework of an Activity,
these groups produce technical reports, review the work of other groups, and
develop sample code or test suites.</p>
<p>The progress of each Activity is documented in an <a name=
"ActivityStatement" id="ActivityStatement">Activity Statement</a>. Activity
Statements describe the goals of the Activity, completed and unfinished
deliverables, changing perspectives based on experience, and future plans. At
least before each <a href="organization.html#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee
meeting</a>, the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> revise the Activity
Statement for each Activity that has not been closed.</p>
<p>Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/activities">list of W3C
Activities</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-activity-list">PUB9</a>].
<strong>Note:</strong> This list <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include some
Activities that began prior to the formalization in 1997 of the Activity
creation process.</p>
<h3>5.1 <a name="ActivityDevelopment" id="ActivityDevelopment">Activity
Proposal Development</a></h3>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> notify the Advisory Committee
when a proposal for a new or modified Activity is in development. This is
intended to raise awareness, even if no formal proposal is yet available.
Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> express
their general support on the <a href=
"organization.html#ACCommunication">Advisory Committee discussion list</a>. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> incorporate discussion points into an
Activity Proposal. Refer to additional <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">tips on getting to Recommendation
faster</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-rec-tips">PUB27</a>].</p>
<h3>5.2 <a name="ActivityCreation" id="ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
Review</a> of an Activity Proposal</h3>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href=
"acreview.html#ReviewAppeal">Advisory Committee review</a> of every proposal to
create, substantively modify, or extend an Activity.</p>
<p>After a Call for Review from the Director, the Advisory Committee <a href=
"acreview.html#ACReview">reviews</a> and comments on the proposal. The review
period <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be at least <span class=
"time-interval">four weeks</span>.</p>
<p>The Director announces to the Advisory Committee whether there is consensus
within W3C to create or modify the Activity (possibly with changes suggested
during the review). For a new Activity, this announcement officially creates
the Activity. This announcement <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include a
<a href="groups.html#cfp">Call for Participation</a> in any groups created as
part of the Activity.</p>
<p>If there was <a href="policies.html#def-Dissent">dissent</a>, Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href=
"acreview.html#ACAppeal">appeal</a> a decision to create, modify, or extend the
Activity. <strong>Note:</strong> There is no appeal of a decision <em>not</em>
to create an Activity; in general, drafting a new Activity Proposal will be
simpler than following the appeal process.</p>
<h3>5.3 <a name="ActivityModification" id="ActivityModification">Modification
of an Activity</a></h3>
<p>Activities are intended to be flexible. W3C expects participants to be able
to adapt in the face of new ideas (e.g., Member Submission requests) and
increased understanding of goals and context, while remaining true to the
intent of the original Activity Proposal. If it becomes necessary to make
substantive changes to an Activity (e.g., because significant additional
resources are necessary or because the Activity's scope has clearly changed
from the original proposal), then the Director <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
review</a> of a complete <a href="#BPCreation">Activity Proposal</a>, including
rationale for the changes.</p>
<h3>5.4 <a name="ActivityExtension" id="ActivityExtension">Extension of an
Activity</a></h3>
<p>When the Director solicits <a href="#ActivityCreation">Advisory Committee
review</a> of a proposal to extend the duration of an Activity with no other
substantive modifications to the composition of the Activity, the proposal
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> indicate the new duration and include
rationale for the extension. The Director is <span class="rfc2119">NOT
REQUIRED</span> to submit a complete <a href="#BPCreation">Activity
Proposal</a>.</p>
<h3>5.5 <a name="ActivityTermination" id="ActivityTermination">Activity
Closure</a></h3>
<p>An Activity Proposal specifies a duration for the Activity. The Director,
subject to <a href="acreview.html#ACAppeal">appeal</a> by Advisory Committee
representatives, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> close an Activity prior to
the date specified in the proposal in any of the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groups in the Activity fail to produce chartered deliverables.</li>
<li>Groups in the Activity produce chartered deliverables ahead of
schedule.</li>
<li>There are insufficient resources to maintain the Activity, according to
priorities established within W3C.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Director closes an Activity by announcement to the Advisory
Committee.</p>
<h3>5.6 <a name="BPCreation" id="BPCreation"></a><a name="ActivityProposal" id=
"ActivityProposal">Activity Proposals</a></h3>
<p>An Activity Proposal defines the initial scope and structure of an Activity.
The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include or reference the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Activity summary. What is the nature of the Activity (e.g., to track
developments, create technical reports, develop code, organize pilot
experiments, or for education)? Who or what group wants this (providers or
users)?</li>
<li>Context information. Why is this Activity being proposed now? What is the
situation in the world (e.g., with respect to the Web community, market,
research, or society)? within the scope of the proposal? Who or what currently
exists that is pertinent to this Activity? Is the community
mature/growing/developing a niche? What competing technologies exist? What
competing organizations exist?</li>
<li>A description of the Activity's scope. How might a potential Recommendation
interact and overlap with existing international standards and Recommendations?
What organizations are likely to be affected by potential overlap (see the
section on <a href="liaisons.html#Liaisons">liaisons with other
organizations</a>)? What should be changed if the Activity is approved?</li>
<li>A description of the Activity's initial deployment, including:
<ul>
<li>The duration of the Activity.</li>
<li>What <a href="groups.html#GAGroups">groups</a> will be created as part of
this Activity and how those groups will be coordinated. For each group, the
proposal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include a provisional charter.
Groups <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be scheduled to run concurrently or
sequentially (either because of a dependency or an expected overlap in
membership and the desirability of working on one subject at a time). These
charters <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be amended based on review comments
before the Director issues a <a href="groups.html#cfp">Call for
Participation</a>.</li>
<li>The expected timeline of the Activity, including proposed deliverable dates
and scheduled <a href="events.html#GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a>.</li>
<li>If known, the date of the first <a href=
"policies.html#ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a> of each proposed group.
The date of the first face-to-face meeting of a proposed group <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be sooner than <span class="time-interval">eight
weeks</span> after the date of the <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity
Proposal</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A summary of resources (Member, Team, administrative, technical, and
financial) expected to be dedicated to the Activity. The proposal <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> specify the threshold level of effort that Members are
expected to pledge in order for the Activity to be accepted.</li>
<li>Information about known dependencies within W3C or outside of W3C.</li>
<li>Intellectual property information. What are the intellectual property
(including patents and copyright) considerations affecting the success of the
Activity? In particular, is there any reason to believe that it will be
difficult to meet the Royalty-Free licensing goals of section 2 of the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent Policy</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>]?</li>
<li>A list of supporters and references. What community is expected to benefit
from this Activity? Are members of this community part of W3C now? Are they
expected to join the effort?</li>
