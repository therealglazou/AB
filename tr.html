    <p>This chapter describes the formal requirements for publishing and
      maintaining a W3C Recommendation or Note. </p>
    <p>Typically a series of Working Drafts are published, each of which refines
      a document under development to complete the scope of work envisioned by a
      Working Group's charter. For a technical specification, once review
      suggests the Working Group has met their requirements satisfactorily for a
      new standard, there is a Candidate Recommendation phase. This allows the
      entire W3C membership to provide feedback on whether the specification
      should become a W3C Recommendation, while the Working Group formally
      collects&nbsp; implementation experience to demonstrate that the
      specification works in practice. The next phase is a Proposed
      Recommendation, to finalize the review of W3C Members. If the Director
      determines that W3C member review supports a specification becoming a
      standard, W3C publishes it as a Recommendation.</p>
    <p>Groups may also publish documents as W3C Notes, typically either to
      document information other than technical specifications, such as use
      cases motivating a specification and best practices for its use, or to
      clarify the status of work that is abandoned. </p>
    <p>Some W3C Notes are developed through successive Working Drafts, with an
      expectation that they will become Notes, while others are simply
      published. There are few formal requirements to publish a document as a
      W3C Note, and they have no standing as a recommendation of W3C but are
      simply documents preserved for historical reference.</p>
    <p>Individual Working Groups and Interest Groups may adopt additional
      processes for developing publications, so long as they do not conflict
      with the requirements in this chapter.</p>

    Reviewers <em class="rfc2119">should</em> send substantive technical
    reviews as early as possible. Working Groups are often reluctant to make <a
      href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to a mature document,
    particularly if this would cause significant compatibility problems due to
    existing implementation. Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em>
    record substantive or interesting proposals raised by reviews but not
    incorporated into a current specification.
    <h5>7.2.3.1 <a id="wide-review">Wide Review</a></h5>
    <p>The requirements for <dfn>wide review</dfn> are not precisely defined by
      the W3C Process. The objective is to ensure that the entire set of
      stakeholders of the Web community, including the general public, have had
      adequate notice of the progress of the Working Group and thereby an
      opportunity to comment on the specification. Before approving transitions,
      the Director will consider who has actually reviewed the document and
      provided comments, the record of requests to and responses from reviewers,
      especially groups identified as dependencies in the charter, and seek
      evidence of clear communication to the general public about appropriate
      times and which content to review. </p>
    <p>For example, inviting review of new or significantly revised sections
      published in Working Drafts, and tracking those comments and the Working
      Group's responses, is generally a good practice which would often be
      considered positive evidence of wide review. Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">should</span>
      announce to other W3C Working Groups as well as the general public,
      especially those affected by this specification, a proposal to enter
      Candidate Recommendation (for example in approximately four weeks). By
      contrast a generic statement in a document requesting review at any time
      is likely not to be considered as sufficient evidence that the group has
      solicited wide review. </p>
    <p>A Working Group could present evidence that wide review has been
      received, irrespective of solicitation. But it is important to note that
      receiving many detailed reviews is not necessarily the same as wide
      review, since they may only represent comment from a small segment of the
      relevant stakeholder community.</p>
    <h4 id="implementation-experience">7.2.4 Implementation Experience</h4>
    <p>Implementation experience is required to show that a specification is
      sufficiently clear, complete, and relevant to market needs, to ensure that
      independent interoperable implementations of each feature of the
      specification will be realized. While no exhaustive list of requirements
      is provided here, when assessing that there is <dfn>adequate
        implementation experience</dfn> the Director will consider (though not
      be limited to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>is each feature of the current specification implemented, and how is
        this demonstrated; (for example, is there a test suite)?</li>
      <li>are there independent interoperable implementations of the current
        specification?</li>
      <li>are there implementations created by people other than the authors of
        the specification?</li>
      <li>are implementations publicly deployed?</li>
      <li>is there implementation experience at all levels of the
        specification's ecosystem (authoring, consuming, publishing…)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Planning and accomplishing a demonstration of (interoperable)
      implementations can be very time consuming. Groups are often able to work
      more effectively if they plan how they will demonstrate interoperable
      implementations early in the development process; for example, they may
      wish to develop tests in concert with implementation efforts.</p>
    <h4 id="correction-classes">7.2.5 Classes of Changes</h4>
    <p>This document distinguishes the following 4 classes of changes to a
      specification. The first two classes of change are considered <dfn id="editorial-change">editorial

      <dd>These changes include fixing broken links, style sheets or invalid

      <dt>2. Corrections that do not affect conformance</dt>
      <dd>Editorial changes or clarifications that do not change the technical
        content of the specification.</dd>
      <dt>3. Corrections that do not add new features</dt>
      <dd>These changes <span class="rfc2119">may</span> affect conformance to
        the specification. A change that affects conformance is one that:

          <li>turns conforming data, processors, or other conforming agents into
            non-conforming agents, or</li>
          <li>turns non-conforming agents into conforming ones, or</li>
          <li>clears up an ambiguity or under-specified part of the
            specification in such a way that an agent whose conformance was once
            unclear becomes clearly conforming or non-conforming.</li>

    <p>The following sections discuss the management of errors and the process
      for making changes to a Recommendation.</p>
    <h4 id="errata">7.7.1 Errata Management</h4>
    <p>Tracking errors is an important part of a Working Group's ongoing care of
      a Recommendation; for this reason, the scope of a Working Group charter
      generally allows time for work after publication of a Recommendation. In
      this Process Document, the term "erratum" (plural "errata") refers to any
      class of mistake, from mere editorial to a serious error that may affect
      the conformance with the Recommendation by software or content (e.g.,
      content validity).</p>
    <p>Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">must</em> track errata on an "errata
      page." An errata page is a list of enumerated errors, possibly accompanied
      by corrections. Each Recommendation links to an errata page; see the
      Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>.</p>
    <p>A correction is first "proposed" by the Working Group. A correction
      becomes part of the Recommendation by the process for Revising a
      Recommendation described in the next section.</p>
    <p>A Working Group <em class="rfc2119">should</em> keep their errata pages
      up-to-date, as errors are reported by readers and implementers. A Working
      Group <em class="rfc2119">must</em> report errata page changes to
      interested parties, notably when corrections are proposed or incorporated
      into an Edited Recommendation, according to the Team's requirements.</p>
    <h4 id="revised-rec">7.7.2 Revising a Recommendation</h4>
    <p><a href="#editorial-change">Editorial changes</a> to a Recommendation
      require no technical review of the proposed changes. A Working Group <span
        class="rfc2119">may</span> request republication of a Recommendation for
      these classes of change, or W3C <span class="rfc2119">may</span>
      republish a Recommendation with this class of change. The modified
      Recommendation is published according to the Team's requirements,

    <p>For <a href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> that do not
      add new features, a Working Group <span class="rfc2119">must</span>
      request publication of an <a href="#rec-edited">Edited Recommendation</a>.</p>
    <p>To publish an Edited Recommendation as a W3C Recommendation, in addition
      to meeting the <a href="#rec-requirements">requirements for all W3C

    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> republish the document, identifying it

    <h3 id="Note">7.8 Publishing a Working Group or Interest Group Note</h3>
    <p>Working Groups and Interest Groups publish material that is not a formal
      specification as Notes. This includes supporting documentation for a

      <li> <em class="rfc2119">may</em> publish a Note with or without its
        prior publication as a Working Draft.</li>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> record the group's decision to request
        publication as a Note, and</li>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">should</em> publish documentation of significant
        changes to the technical report since any previous publication.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Possible next steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>End state: A technical report <em class="rfc2119">may</em> remain a
        Working Group Note indefinitely</li>
      <li>A Working Group <em class="rfc2119">may</em> resume work on technical
        report within the scope of its charter at any time, at the maturity
        level the specification had before publication as a Note</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent
        Policy</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>]
      does not specify any licensing requirements or commitments for Working
      Group Notes.</p>
    <h3 id="rec-rescind">7.9 Rescinding a W3C Recommendation</h3>
    <p>W3C <em class="rfc2119">may</em> rescind a Recommendation, for example
      if the Recommendation contains many errors that conflict with a later
      version or if W3C discovers burdensome patent claims that affect
      implementers and cannot be resolved; see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
        Patent Policy</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>]
      and in particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Requirements">section
        5</a> (bullet 10) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-PAG-conclude">section
        7.5</a>. A Working Group <em class="rfc2119">may</em> request the
      Director to rescind a Recommendation which was a deliverable, or the
      Director <em class="rfc2119">may</em> directly propose to rescind a
      Recommendation. </p>
    <p>W3C only rescinds entire specifications. To rescind some <em>part</em>
      of a Recommendation, W3C follows the process for <a href="#rec-modify">modifying
        a Recommendation</a>.</p>
    <p>Once W3C has published a Rescinded Recommendation, future W3C technical
      reports <em class="rfc2119">must not</em> include normative references to
      that technical report.</p>
    <p>To propose rescinding a W3C Recommendation, a Working Group or the
      Director</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> publish rationale for rescinding the
        Recommendation.</li>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">should</em> document known implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition a Working Group requesting to rescind</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> show that the request to rescind has
        received <a href="#wide-review">wide review</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition the Director, if proposing to rescind</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> show that the request to rescind is
        based on public comment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Director <em class="rfc2119">must</em> announce the proposal to
      rescind a W3C Recommendation to other W3C groups, the public, and the <a
        href="organization.html#AC">Advisory
        Committee</a>. The announcement <em class="rfc2119">must</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>indicate that this is a Proposal to Rescind a Recommendation</li>
      <li>specify the deadline for review comments, which <em class="rfc2119">must</em>
        be at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks after announcing</span>
        the proposal to rescind.</li>
      <li>identify known dependencies and solicit review from all dependent
        Working Groups;</li>
      <li>solicit public review.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there was any <a href="policies.html#def-Dissent"
        rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>
      in Advisory Committee reviews, the Director <em class="rfc2119">must</em>
      publish the substantive content of the dissent to W3C <strong>and the
        public</strong>, and <em class="rfc2119">must</em> <a href="policies.html#formal-address">formally
        address</a> the comment at least 14 days before publication as a
      Rescinded Recommendation. In this case the <a href="organization.html#AC">Advisory
        Committee</a> <em class="rfc2119">may</em> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a>
      the decision.</p>
    <p> A Rescinded Recommendation <em class="rfc2119">must</em> be published
      with up to date status. The updated version <em class="rfc2119">may</em>
      remove the rescinded content (i.e. the main body of the document).</p>
