        <p>This is a revised draft proposal to replace the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html">current
            chapter 7 of the W3C process document</a> with a more effective W3C
          Specification life cycle following the meeting of the W3C Advisory
          Board's Chapter 7 Task Force on 21 October 2013. This document is an
          editor's draft of a "Last Call" version. The Task Force resolved at
          its 21 October meeting to recommend the agreed draft (although the
          last version they saw was the 9 October draft) as a "Last Call" draft
          proposed for adoption by the Advisory Committee as a replacement for
          the existing Chapter 7. Review will take place over several weeks,
          including the week of W3C's TPAC meeting (10-15 November), before a
          formal decision on adoption is made.</p>
        <p>An initial version was first proposed to the W3C Advisory Board on 13
          May 2013 as a possible replacement for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html">current
            chapter 7 of the W3C process document</a>, and a <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/Zikwkr385JG8f">subsequent
            version</a> was <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2013May/0023.html">proposed</a>
          to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/">W3C Process
            Community Group</a> on 29 May 2013 by Charles Nevile &lt;<a href="mailto:chaals@yandex-team.ru">chaals@yandex-team.ru</a>&gt;
          for discussion. Subsequent editor's drafts have been public, to enable
          broad input. However, following the existing process, the Advisory
          Board retains formal responsibility for decisions on what it proposes
          to the Advisory Committee, and the adoption of any change to the
          process will follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/processdoc.html#GAProcess">existing
            process for such changes</a>, subject to the resolution of <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/track/issues/39">ISSUE-39</a>.</p>
        <p>I am grateful to the W3C Advisory Board, the W3C Process Community
          Group, Art Barstow, Robin Berjon, Wayne Carr, Marcos Cáceres, Ivan
          Herman, Ian Hickson, Ian Jacobs, Jeff Jaffe, Chris Lilley, Ralph
          Swick, Anne van Kesteren, Steve Zilles, and many people I have
          forgotten to acknowledge for suggestions, comments and discussions
          that helped me sort out my thinking, and to Ora Lassila for the
          original version of the image that illustrates the normal process of a
          W3C Recommendation-track document. </p>
        <p>Please send comments on this document to, or participate in, the <a
            href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/">W3C Process Community
            Group</a>. Issues related to this proposal are recorded in that
          group's issue tracker using the product "<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/track/products/1">Document
            Lifecycle (chapter 7)</a>"</p>
        Major changes:
        <ul>
          <li>There is a requirement that Working groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em>
            document known implementation for all transitions</li>
          <li>New sections give some guidance on what is considered when
            assessing "<a href="#implementation-experience">adequate
              implementation experience</a>" and "<a href="#wide-review">wide
              review</a>"</li>
          <li>Last Call and Candidate Recommendation have been collapsed
            together. Some of the requirements are therefore enforced earlier in
            the process.</li>
          <li>Proposed Recommendation is no longer a separate step. Advisory
            Committee review now begins at the same time as Candidate
            recommendation, and ends 4 weeks after the Working group has
            provisional approval for a Request to publish as a W3C
            Recommendation.</li>
          <li>The Director is required to address AC review comments <strong>publicly</strong>,
            2 weeks <em>before</em> publication of a Recommendation.</li>
          <li>And it is in HTML5</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Editorially, I have tried to rationalize requirements, and clarify
          who is responsible for meeting them. I have also actively removed
          advice and general statements to keep this version short.</p>

    <p>Because the requirements for First Public Working Drafts are fairly
      mechanical approval is normally fairly automatic, whereas for later stages
      there is generally a formal review meeting to ensure the requirements have
      been met before Director's approval is given.</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="substantive-change">7.2.1 Substantive Change</h4>
    <p> A <dfn>substantive change</dfn> (whether deletion, inclusion, or other
      modification) is one where someone could reasonably expect that making the
      change would invalidate an individual's review or implementation
      experience. Other changes (e.g., clarifications, bug fixes, editorial
      repairs, and minor error corrections) are minor changes.</p>
    <h4>7.2.2 <a id="wide-review">Wide Review</a></h4>
    <p>The requirements for <dfn>wide review</dfn> are not precisely defined by
      the process. The objective is to ensure that the entire set of
      stakeholders of the Web community, including the general public, have had
      adequate notice of the progress of the Working Group and thereby an
      opportunity to comment on the specification. Before approving transitions,
      the Director will consider who has actually reviewed the document and
      provided comments, the record of requests to and responses from reviewers,
      especially groups identified as dependencies in the charter, and seek
      evidence of clear communication to the general public about appropriate
      times and which content to review. </p>
    <p>For example, inviting review of new or significantly revised sections
      published in Working Drafts, and tracking those comments and the Working
      Group's responses, is generally a good practice which would often be
      considered positive evidence of wide review. A recommended practice is
      making a specific announcement to other W3C Working Groups as well as the
      general public that a group proposes to enter Candidate Recommendation in
      e.g. approximately four weeks. By contrast a generic statement in a
      document requesting review at any time is likely not to be considered as
      sufficient evidence that the group has solicited wide review. </p>
    <p>A Working Group could present evidence that wide review has been
      received, irrespective of solicitation. But it is important to note that
      receiving many detailed reviews is not necessarily the same as wide
      review, since they may only represent comment from a small segment of the
      relevant stakeholder community.</p>
    <h4 id="implementation-experience">7.2.3 Implementation Experience</h4>
    <p>Implementation experience is required to show that a specification is
      sufficiently clear, complete, and relevant to market needs, to ensure that
      independent interoperable implementations of each feature of the
      specification will be realized. While no exhaustive list of requirements
      is provided here, when assessing that there is <dfn>adequate
        implementation experience</dfn> the Director will consider (though not
      be limited to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>is each feature implemented, and how is this demonstrated; (for
        example, is there a test suite)?</li>
      <li>are there independent interoperable implementations?</li>
      <li>are there implementations created by other than the authors of the
        specification?</li>
      <li>are implementations publicly deployed?</li>
      <li>is there implementation experience at all levels of the
        specification's ecosystem (creation, consuming, publishing…)?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Planning and accomplishing a demonstration of (interoperable)
      implementations can be very time consuming. Groups are often able to work
      more effectively if they plan how they will demonstrate interoperable
      implementations early in the development process; for example, they may
      wish to develop tests in concert with implementation efforts.</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>7.3 <a name="doc-reviews" id="doc-reviews">Reviews and Review
        Responsibilities</a></h3>
    <p>A document is available for review from the moment it is first published.
      Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em> <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#formal-address">formally
        address</a> <em>any</em> substantive review comment about a technical
      report in a timely manner. </p>
    Reviewers <em class="rfc2119">should</em> send substantive technical
    reviews as early as possible. Working Groups are often reluctant to make <a
      href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to a mature document,
    particularly if this would cause significant compatibility problems due to
    existing implementation. Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em>
    record substantive or interesting proposals raised by reviews but not
    incorporated into a current specification.

      practices and the like.</p>
    <p>Work on a technical report <em class="rfc2119">may</em> cease at any
      time. Work <em class="rfc2119 new">should</em> cease if W3C or a Working
      Group determines that it cannot productively carry the work any further.

        a Working Group</a> W3C <em class="rfc2119">must </em> publish any
      unfinished specifications on the Recommendation track as Working Group

    </ul>
    <p>The W3C Patent Policy does not specify any licensing requirements or
      commitments for Working Group Notes, only for W3C Recommendations. See
      also the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent

    <h3>7.6 <a name="rec-modify" id="rec-modify">Modifying a W3C Recommendation</a></h3>
    <p>The following sections discuss the management of errors and the process
      for making normative changes to a Recommendation.</p>
    <h4>7.6.1 <a name="errata" id="errata">Errata Management</a></h4>
    <p>Tracking errors is an important part of a Working Group's ongoing care of
      a Recommendation; for this reason, the scope of a Working Group charter
      generally allows time for work after publication of a Recommendation. In
      this Process Document, the term "erratum" (plural "errata") refers to any
      class of mistake, from mere editorial to a serious error that may affect
      the conformance with the Recommendation by software or content (e.g.,
      content validity). <strong>Note:</strong> Before a document becomes a
      Recommendation, the W3C Process focuses on <a href="#substantive-change">substantive
        changes</a> (those related to prior reviews). After a document has been
      published as Recommendation, the W3C Process focuses on those changes to a
      technical report that might affect the conformance of content or deployed
      software.</p>
    <p>Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">must</span> track errata on an
      "errata page." An errata page is a list of enumerated errors, possibly
      accompanied by corrections. Each Recommendation links to an errata page;
      see the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication
        Rules</a>.</p>
    <p>A correction is first "proposed" by the Working Group. A correction
      becomes normative by the process described below.</p>
    <p>A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">should</span> keep their errata
      pages up-to-date, as errors are reported by readers and implementers. A
      Working Group <span class="rfc2119">must</span> report errata page
      changes to interested parties, notably when corrections are proposed or
      become normative, according to the Team's requirements. For instance, the
      Team might set up a mailing list per Recommendation where a Working Group
      reports changes to an errata page.</p>
    <h4>7.6.2 <a name="correction-classes" id="correction-classes">Classes of
        Changes to a Recommendation</a></h4>
    <p>This document distinguishes the following classes of changes to a
      Recommendation.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>1. No changes to text content</dt>
      <dd>These changes include fixing broken links, style sheets or invalid
        markup.</dd>
      <dt>2. Corrections that do not affect conformance</dt>
      <dd>Editorial changes or clarifications that do not change the technical
        content of the specification.</dd>
      <dt>3. Corrections that do not add new features</dt>
      <dd>These changes <span class="rfc2119">may</span> affect conformance to
        the Recommendation. A change that affects conformance is one that:
        <ul>
          <li>turns conforming data, processors, or other conforming agents into
            non-conforming agents, or</li>
          <li>turns non-conforming agents into conforming ones, or</li>
          <li>clears up an ambiguity or under-specified part of the
            specification in such a way that an agent whose conformance was once
            unclear becomes clearly conforming or non-conforming.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>4. New features</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>The first two classes of change require no technical review of the
      proposed changes. A Working Group <span class="rfc2119">may</span>
      request republication of a Recommendation for these classes of change, or
      W3C <span class="rfc2119">may</span> republish a Recommendation with this
      class of change. The modified Recommendation is published according to the
      Team's requirements, including <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication
        Rules</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>] and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/republishing/">Requirements
        for modification of W3C Technical Reports</a> [PUB@@].</p>
    <p>For the third class of change, a Working Group <span class="rfc2119">must</span>
      request publication of an <a href="#rec-edited">Edited Recommendation</a>.</p>
    <p>For the fourth class of change, which introduces a new feature or
      features, W3C <span class="rfc2119">must</span> follow the full process
      of <a href="#rec-advance">advancing a technical report to Recommendation</a>.</p>
    <h3>7.7 <a name="rec-rescind" id="rec-rescind">Rescinding a W3C
        Recommendation</a></h3>
    <p>W3C <em class="rfc2119">may</em> rescind a Recommendation, for example
      if the Recommendation contains many errors that conflict with a later
      version or if W3C discovers burdensome patent claims that affect
      implementers and cannot be resolved; see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
        Patent Policy</a> [<a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>]
      and in particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Requirements">section
        5</a> (bullet 10) and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-PAG-conclude">section
        7.5</a>. A Working Group <em class="rfc2119">may</em> request the
      Director to rescind a Recommendation which was a deliverable, or the
      Director <em class="rfc2119">may</em> directly propose to rescind a
      Recommendation. </p>
    <p>To deprecate <em>part</em> of a Recommendation, W3C follows the process
      for <a href="#rec-modify">modifying a Recommendation</a>.</p>
    <p>Once W3C has published a Rescinded Recommendation, future W3C technical
      reports <em class="rfc2119">must not</em> include normative references to
      that technical report.</p>
    <p>To propose rescinding a W3C Recommendation, a Working Group or the
      Director</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> publish rationale for rescinding the
        Recommendation.</li>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">should</em> document known implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition a Working Group proposing to rescind</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> show that the request to rescind has
        received <a href="#wide-review">wide review</a></li>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">should</em> show that the request to rescind is
        based on public comment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition the Director, if proposing to rescind</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em class="rfc2119">must</em> show that the request to rescind is
        based on public comment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Director <em class="rfc2119">must</em> announce the proposal to
      rescind a W3C Recommendation to other W3C groups, the public, and the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/organization.html#AC">Advisory
        Committee</a>. The announcement <em class="rfc2119">must</em>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>indicate that this is a Proposal to Rescind a Recommendation</li>
      <li>specify the deadline for review comments, which <em class="rfc2119">must</em>
        be at least <span class="time-interval">four weeks after publication </span></li>
      <li>identify known dependencies and solicit review from all dependent
        Working Groups;</li>
      <li>solicit public review.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there was any <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#def-Dissent"
        rel="glossary" title="Definition of Dissent"><span class="dfn-instance">dissent</span></a>
      in Advisory Committee reviews, the Director <em class="rfc2119">must</em>
