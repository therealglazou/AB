This document is an editor's draft for the          Advisory Board but does not yet fully reflect consensus. </p>        <p>An earlier version was first proposed to the W3C Advisory Board on 13          May 2013 as a possible replacement for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html">current

            version</a> was&nbsp; <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/2013May/0023.html">proposed</a>          to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/">W3C Process            Community Group</a> on 29 May 2013 by Charles Nevile &lt;<a href="mailto:chaals@yandex-team.ru">chaals@yandex-team.ru</a>          for discussion. The Advisory Board has agreed to make all editor's          drafts public, to enable broad input. However, following the existing          process, the Advisory Board retains formal responsibility for          decisions on what it proposes to the Advisory Committee, and the          adoption of any change to the process will follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/processdoc.html#GAProcess">existing
            process for such changes</a>.</p>        <p>I am grateful to the W3C Advisory Board, the W3C Process Community          Group, Art Barstow, Robin Berjon, Wayne Carr, Marcos Cáceres, Tantek          Çelik, Ian Hickson, Ian Jacobs, Ralph Swick, Anne van Kesteren, and          many people I have forgotten to acknowledge for suggestions, comments          and discussions the helped me sort out my thinking, and to Ora Lassila          for the image that illustrates the normal process of a W3C          Recommendation-track document. </p>        <p>Please send comments on this document to, or participate in, the <a            href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/">W3C
            Process Community Group</a>. Issues related to this proposal are          tracked in that group's issue tracker using the product "<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/track/products/1">Document
            Lifecycle (chapter 7)</a>"</p>        Major changes:        <ul>          <li>Last Call and Candidate Recommendation have been collapsed            together. Some of the requirements are therefore enforced earlier in            the process.</li>          <li>Proposed Recommendation is no longer a separate step. Advisory            Committee review now begins at the same time as Last Call Candidate            recommendation, and ends 4 weeks after the Working group has            provisional approval for a Request to publish as a W3C            Recommendation.</li>          <li>The director is required to address AC review comments <strong>publicly</strong>,            2 weeks <em>before</em> publication of a Recommendation.</li>          <li>The chapter is about half the size it was. </li>          <li>And it is in HTML5</li>        </ul>        <p>Editorially, I have tried to rationalize requirements, and clarify          who is responsible for meeting them. I have also actively removed          advice and general statements to keep this version short.</p>      </div>    </div>    <h2>7 <a name="Reports" id="Reports">W3C Technical Report Development        Process</a></h2>    <p>The W3C technical report development process is the set of steps and      requirements followed by W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups#GroupsWG">Working

The objective is to ensure that the entire set of stakeholders of      the Web community, including the general public, have had adequate notice      of the progress of the Working Group and thereby an opportunity to comment      on the specification. Before approving transitions, the Director will      consider who has actually reviewed the document and provided comments,      particularly in light of the listed dependencies, and how the Working      Group has solicited and responded to review. In particular, the Director      is likely to consider the record of requests to and responses from groups      identified as dependencies in the charter, as well as seeking evidence of      clear communication to the general public about appropriate times and      which content to review. </p>    <p>As an example, inviting review of new or significantly revised sections      published in Heartbeat Working Drafts, and tracking those comments and the      Working Group's responses, is generally a good practice which would often      be considered positive evidence of wide review. Many Working Groups make a      specific announcement that they propose to enter Last Call in e.g.      approximately four weeks, to other W3C Working Groups as well as the      general public. By contrast a generic statement in a document requesting      review at any time is likely not to be considered as sufficient evidence      that the group has solicited wide review. </p>    <p>A Working Group could present evidence that wide review has been      received, irrespective of solicitation. But it is important to note that      receiving many detailed reviews is not necessarily the same as wide      review, since they may only represent comment from a small segment of the      relevant stakeholder community.</p>    <h3>7.3 <a name="doc-reviews" id="doc-reviews">Reviews and Review        Responsibilities</a></h3>    <p>A document is available for review from the moment it is first published.      Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em> <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/policies.html#formal-address">formally
