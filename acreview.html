<p>This section describes how the Advisory Committee reviews proposals from the
Director and how Advisory Committee representatives appeal W3C decisions and
decisions by the Director. A <a name="def-w3c-decision" id=
"def-w3c-decision">W3C decision</a> is one where the Director (or the
Director's delegate) has exercised the role of assessing consensus after an
<a href="#ACReview">Advisory Committee review</a> of an <a href=
"activities.html#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>, after a <a href=
"tr.html#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>, after a
<a href="tr.html#cfr-edited">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>,
after a <a href="tr.html#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal to Rescind a W3C
Recommendation</a>, and after a <a href="processdoc.html#GAProcess">Proposed
Process Document</a> review.</p>
<h3>8.1 <a name="ACReview" id="ACReview">Advisory Committee Reviews</a></h3>
<p>The Advisory Committee reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>proposals for <a href="activities.html#ActivityCreation">new</a>, <a href=
"activities.html#ActivityModification">modified</a>, and <a href=
"activities.html#ActivityExtension">extended Activities</a>,</li>
<li><a href="groups.html#CharterReview">new and modified Working and Interest
Groups</a>,</li>
<li><a href="tr.html#cfr">Proposed Recommendations</a>, <a href=
"tr.html#cfr-edited">Proposed Edited Recommendations</a>, <a href=
"tr.html#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal to Rescind a Recommendation</a>,
and</li>
<li><a href="processdoc.html#GAProcess">Proposed changes to the W3C
process</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>8.1.1 <a name="ACReviewStart" id="ACReviewStart">Start of a Review
Period</a></h4>
<p>Each Advisory Committee review period begins with a Call for Review from the
Team to the Advisory Committee. The <a name="reviewform" id="reviewform">review
form</a> describes the proposal, raises attention to deadlines, estimates when
the decision will be available, and includes other practical information. Each
Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> send one review, which
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be returned by its Advisory Committee
representative.</p>
<p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two channels for Advisory
Committee review comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>an archived <a href="comm.html#Team-only">Team-only</a> channel; this is
the default channel for reviews.</li>
<li>an archived <a href="comm.html#Member-only">Member-only</a> channel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> send information to either or
both channels. They <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also share their reviews
with other Members on the <a href="organization.html#ACCommunication">Advisory
Committee discussion list</a>.</p>
<p>A Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> modify its review
during a review period (e.g., in light of comments from other Members).</p>
<h4>8.1.2 <a name="ACReviewAfter" id="ACReviewAfter">After the Review
Period</a></h4>
<p>After the review period, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
announce to the Advisory Committee the level of support for the proposal
(<a href="policies.html#def-Consensus">consensus</a> or <a href=
"policies.html#def-Dissent">dissent</a>). The Director <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> also indicate whether there were any Formal Objections,
with attention to <a href="comm.html#confidentiality-change">changing
confidentiality level</a>. This <a href="#def-w3c-decision">W3C decision</a> is
generally one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The proposal is approved, possibly with <a href=
"tr.html#minor-change">minor changes</a> integrated.</li>
<li>The proposal is approved, possibly with <a href=
"tr.html#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> integrated. In this case
the Director's announcement <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include rationale
for the decision to advance the document despite the proposal for a substantive
change.</li>
<li>The proposal is returned for additional work, with a request to the
initiator to <a href="policies.html#formal-address">formally address</a>
certain issues.</li>
<li>The proposal is rejected.</li>
</ol>
<p>This document does not specify time intervals between the end of an Advisory
Committee review period and the <a href="#def-w3c-decision">W3C decision</a>.
This is to ensure that the Members and Team have sufficient time to consider
comments gathered during the review. The Advisory Committee <span class=
"rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> expect an announcement sooner than <span class=
"time-interval">two weeks</span> after the end of a Proposed Recommendation
review period. If, after <span class="time-interval">three weeks</span>, the
Director has not announced the outcome, the Director <span class=
"rfc2119">SHOULD</span> provide the Advisory Committee with an update.</p>
<h3>8.2 <a name="ACAppeal" id="ACAppeal">Appeal by Advisory Committee
Representatives</a></h3>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal
certain decisions, though appeals are only expected to occur in extraordinary
circumstances.</p>
<p>When Advisory Committee review immediately precedes a decision, Advisory
Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> only appeal when
there is <a href="policies.html#def-Dissent">dissent</a>. These decisions
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tr.html#rec-publication">Publication of a Recommendation</a> or
<a href="tr.html#publication-rescinded-rec">Publication of a Rescinded
Recommendation</a>,</li>
<li><a href="activities.html#ActivityProposal">Activity creation</a>, <a href=
"activities.html#ActivityModification">modification</a>, or <a href=
"activities.html#ActivityExtension">extension</a>,</li>
<li><a href="groups.html#cfp">Working or Interest Group creation</a> or
<a href="groups.html#charter-extension">extension</a>,</li>
<li>Changes to the <a href="processdoc.html#GAProcess">W3C process</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> always
appeal the following decisions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="activities.html#ActivityTermination">Activity closure</a>,</li>
<li><a href="groups.html#charter-extension">Working or Interest Group
extension</a> or <a href="groups.html#GeneralTermination">closure</a>,</li>
<li><a href="tr.html#cfi">Call for Implementations</a>, <a href=
"tr.html#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>, <a href=
"tr.html#cfr-edited">Call for Review of an Edited Recommendation</a>, or
<a href="tr.html#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal to Rescind a
Recommendation</a></li>
<li>the Director's intention to sign a <a href="liaisons.html#mou">Memorandum
of Understanding</a> with another organization.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, an appeal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be initiated
within <span class="time-interval">three weeks</span> of the decision.</p>
<p>An Advisory Committee representative initiates an appeal by sending a
request to the Team (explained in detail in the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member Orientation</a>). The Team
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> announce the appeal process to the Advisory
Committee and provide an address for comments from Advisory Committee
representatives. The archive of these comments <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> be Member-visible. If, within <span class=
"time-interval">one week</span> of the Team's announcement, 5% or more of the
Advisory Committee support the appeal request, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> organize an appeal vote asking the Advisory Committee to
approve or reject the decision. <!-- Voting procedure to be determined --></p>
<h3>8.3 <a name="ACVotes" id="ACVotes">Advisory Committee Votes</a></h3>
<p>The Advisory Committee votes in <a href=
"organization.html#AB-TAG-elections">elections for seats on the TAG or Advisory
Board</a>, and in the event of a formal appeal of a <a href=
"#def-w3c-decision">W3C decision</a>. Whenever the Advisory Committee votes,
each Member or group of <a href="organization.html#MemberRelated">related
Members</a> has one vote. In the case of <a href=
"organization.html#AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and TAG elections</a>, "one
vote" means "one vote per available seat".</p>
