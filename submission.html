<p>The Member Submission process allows Members to propose technology or other
ideas for consideration by the Team. After review, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the material at the W3C Web site. The formal
process affords Members a record of their contribution and gives them a
mechanism for disclosing the details of the transaction with the Team
(including IPR claims). The Team also publishes review comments on the
Submitted materials for W3C Members, the public, and the media.</p>
<p>A <a name="MemberSubmission" id="MemberSubmission">Member Submission</a>
consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more documents developed outside of the W3C process, and</li>
<li>Information about the documents, provided by the Submitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>One or more Members (called the "Submitter(s)") <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> participate in a Member Submission. Only W3C Members
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be listed as Submitter(s).</p>
<p>The Submission process consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the Submitter(s) sends a request to the Team to acknowledge the
Submission request. The Team and Submitter(s) communicate to ensure that the
Member Submission is complete.</li>
<li>After Team review, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> either
acknowledge or reject the Submission request.
<ul>
<li>If <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledged</a>, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> publish the Member Submission at the public W3C Web site,
in addition to Team comments about the Member Submission.</li>
<li>If <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected</a>, the Submitter(s) <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to either the <a href=
"organization.html#TAG">TAG</a> or the <a href="organization.html#AB">Advisory
Board</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid confusion about the Member Submission
process, please note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documents in a Member Submission are developed outside of W3C. These
documents are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href=
"tr.html#Reports">technical report development process</a> (and therefore are
not included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">index of W3C technical
reports</a>). Members wishing to have documents developed outside of W3C
published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the Member Submission
process.</li>
<li>The Submission process is <strong>not</strong> a means by which Members ask
for "ratification" of these documents as <a href="tr.html#RecsW3C">W3C
Recommendations</a>.</li>
<li>There is no requirement or guarantee that technology which is part of an
acknowledged Submission request will receive further consideration by W3C
(e.g., by a W3C Working Group).</li>
</ul>
<p>Publication of a Member Submission by W3C does not imply endorsement by W3C,
including the W3C Team or Members. The acknowledgment of a Submission request
does not imply that any action will be taken by W3C. It merely records publicly
that the Submission request has been made by the Submitter. A Member Submission
published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> be referred to as "work
in progress" of the W3C.</p>
<p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">acknowledged Member
Submissions</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-submission-list">PUB10</a>] is
available at the W3C Web site.</p>
<h3>11.1 <a name="SubmissionRights" id="SubmissionRights">Submitter Rights and
Obligations</a></h3>
<p>When more than one Member jointly participates in a Submission request, only
one Member formally sends in the request. That Member <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> copy each of the Advisory Committee representatives of
the other participating Members, and each of those Advisory Committee
representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> confirm (by email to the
Team) their participation in the Submission request.</p>
<p>At any time prior to acknowledgment, any Submitter <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> withdraw support for a Submission request (described in
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a Submission
request</a>"). A Submission request is "withdrawn" when no Submitter(s) support
it. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make statements about
withdrawn Submission requests.</p>
<p>Prior to acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, refer to a document as
"submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium" or "under consideration by W3C" or
any similar phrase either in public or Member communication. The Submitter(s)
<span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> imply in public or Member communication
that W3C is working (with the Submitter(s)) on the material in the Member
Submission. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the
documents in the Member Submission prior to acknowledgment (without reference
to the Submission request).</p>
<p>After acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, imply W3C investment in
the Member Submission until, and unless, the material has been adopted as part
of a W3C <a href="activities.html#def-Activity">Activity</a>.</p>
<h4>11.1.1 <a name="SubmissionScope" id="SubmissionScope">Scope of Member
Submissions</a></h4>
<p>When a technology overlaps in scope with the work of a chartered Working
Group, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> <a href=
"groups.html#group-participation">participate in the Working Group</a> and
contribute the technology to the group's process rather than seek publication
through the Member Submission process. The Working Group <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> incorporate the contributed technology into its
deliverables. If the Working Group does not incorporate the technology, it
<span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> publish the contributed documents as
Working Group Notes since Working Group Notes represent group output, not input
to the group.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while W3C is in the early stages of developing an
Activity Proposal or charter, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> use
the Submission process to build consensus around concrete proposals for new
work.</p>
<p>Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> submit materials covering
topics well outside the scope of <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/#mission">W3C's mission</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-mission">PUB15</a>].</p>
<h4>11.1.2 <a name="SubmissionReqs" id="SubmissionReqs">Information Required in
a Submission Request</a></h4>
<p>The Submitter(s) and any other authors of the submitted material
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> agree that, if the request is acknowledged,
the documents in the Member Submission will be subject to the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C Document
License</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>] and will include a
reference to it. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> hold the
copyright for the documents in a Member Submission.</p>
<p>The request must satisfy the Member Submission licensing commitments of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-submissions">section
3.3</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent
Policy</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
<p>The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The list of all submitting Members.</li>
<li>Position statements from all submitting Members (gathered by the
Submitter). All position statements must appear in a separate document.</li>
<li>Complete electronic copies of any documents submitted for consideration
(e.g., a technical specification, a position paper, etc.) If the Submission
request is acknowledged, these documents will be published by W3C and therefore
must satisfy the Communication Team's <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a> [<a href=
"refs.html#ref-pubrules">PUB31</a>]. Submitters may hold the copyright for the
material contained in these documents, but when published by W3C, these
documents <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be subject to the provisions of the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C Document
License</a> [<a href="refs.html#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>].</li>
</ul>
<p>The request <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> also answer the following
questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What proprietary technology is required to implement the areas addressed by
the request, and what terms are associated with its use? Again, many answers
are possible, but the specific answer will affect the Team's decision.</li>
<li>What resources, if any, does the Submitter intend to make available if the
W3C acknowledges the Submission request and takes action on it?</li>
<li>What action would the Submitter like W3C to take if the Submission request
is acknowledged?</li>
<li>What mechanisms are there to make changes to the specification being
submitted? This includes, but is not limited to, stating where change control
will reside if the request is acknowledged.</li>
</ul>
<p>For other administrative requirements related to Submission requests, see
"<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a Submission
request</a>" [<a href="refs.html#ref-member-sub">MEM8</a>].</p>
<h3>11.2 <a name="TeamSubmissionRights" id="TeamSubmissionRights">Team Rights
and Obligations</a></h3>
<p>Although they are not technical reports, the documents in a Member
Submission <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the requirements
established by the Team, including the Team's <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>.</p>
<p>The Team sends a <a name="validation-notice" id=
"validation-notice">validation notice</a> to the Submitter(s) once the Team has
reviewed a Submission request and judged it complete and correct.</p>
<p>Prior to a decision to <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledge</a> or <a href=
"#SubmissionNo">reject</a> the request, the request is <a href=
"comm.html#Team-only">Team-only</a>, and the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> hold it in the strictest confidentiality. In particular,
the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> comment to the media about the
Submission request.</p>
<h3>11.3 <a name="SubmissionYes" id="SubmissionYes">Acknowledgment of a
Submission Request</a></h3>
<p>The Director <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledges</a> a Submission request
by sending an announcement to the Advisory Committee. Though the announcement
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made at any time, the Submitter(s) can
expect an announcement between <span class="time-interval">four to six
weeks</span> after the <a href="#validation-notice">validation notice</a>. The
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> keep the Submitter(s) informed of when
an announcement is likely to be made.</p>
<p>Once a Submission request has been acknowledged, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish the Member Submission.</li>
<li>Publish Team comments about the Submission request.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Submitter(s) wishes to modify a document published as the result of
acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> start the
Submission process from the beginning, even just to correct editorial
changes.</p>
<h3>11.4 <a name="SubmissionNo" id="SubmissionNo">Rejection of a Submission
Request</a></h3>
<p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reject a Submission request
for a variety of reasons, including any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request overlap in scope with the work of a
chartered Working Group, and acknowledgment might jeopardize the progress of
the group.</li>
<li>The IPR statement made by the Submitter(s) is inconsistent with the W3C's
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">Patent Policy</a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>], <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">Document License</a>
[<a href="refs.html#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>], or other IPR policies.</li>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request are poor, might harm the Web, or run
counter to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/#mission">W3C's
mission</a>.</li>
<li>The ideas expressed in the request lie well outside the scope of W3C's
mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of a rejection, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform
the Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitter(s). If requested by
the Submitter(s), the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide rationale
to the Submitter(s) about the rejection. Other than to the Submitter(s), the
Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make statements about why a
Submission request was rejected.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitters(s) <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal the rejection to the <a href=
"organization.html#TAG">TAG</a> if the reasons are related to Web architecture,
or to the <a href="organization.html#AB">Advisory Board</a> if the request is
rejected for other reasons. In this case the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">SHOULD</span> make available its rationale for the rejection to the
appropriate body. The Team will establish a process for such appeals that
ensures the appropriate <a href="comm.html#confidentiality-levels">level of
confidentiality</a>.</p>
