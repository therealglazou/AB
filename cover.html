    <h2 class="notoc"><a id="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
    <p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr>W3C</abbr>) is to
      lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing common
      protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its interoperability. The
      W3C Process Document describes the organizational structure of the W3C and
      the processes related to the responsibilities and functions they exercise
      to enable W3C to accomplish its mission. This document does not describe
      the internal workings of the Team or W3C's public communication
      mechanisms.</p>
    <p>For more information about the W3C mission and the history of W3C, please
      refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/">About W3C</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>].</p>
    <h2 class="notoc"><a id="status">Status of this Document</a></h2>
    <p>This is the 14 August 2014 Editor's draft for the next version of the W3C
      Process Document. This document is a copy of the 1 August 2014 Process,
      developed between the <a href="/2002/ab/">W3C Advisory Board</a> and the
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/">Revising W3C Process
        Community Group</a> and adopted as the currently operative Process.
      During the rest of 2014 the document will be developed, in preparation for
      adopting a revised process in 2015.</p>
    <p>W3C, including all existing chartered groups, follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">most
        recent operative Process Document</a> announced to the Membership.</p>
    <p>Please send comments about this document to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/w3process/">Revising
        W3C Process Community Group</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-w3process/">Mailing
        list archive</a>, publicly available) or to process-issues@w3.org (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/process-issues">Member-only
        archive</a>). A <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/track/">Public
        Issue Tracker</a> and <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/AB/">detailed
        changelogs</a> are available online.</p>
    <p>The terms <em class="rfc2119">must</em>, <em class="rfc2119">must not</em>,
      <em class="rfc2119">should</em>, <em class="rfc2119">should not</em>, <em
        class="rfc2119">required</em>, and <em class="rfc2119">may</em> are
      used in accordance with <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC
        2119</a> [<a href="#ref-RFC2119">RFC2119</a>]. The term <dfn><em class="rfc2119">not
          required</em></dfn> is equivalent to the term <em class="rfc2119">may</em>
      as defined in RFC 2119. <span class="issue">move this sentence out of

    <p>Some terms have been capitalized in this document (and in other W3C
      materials) to indicate that they are entities with special relevance to
      the W3C Process. These terms are defined herein, and readers should be
      aware that the ordinary (English) definitions are incomplete for purposes
      of understanding this document. <span class="issue">move this sentence
        out of status</span></p>
    <h2 class="notoc"><a id="pp">Relation of Process Document to Patent Policy</a></h2>
    <p>W3C Members' attention is called to the fact that provisions of the
      Process Document are binding on Members per the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
        Agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-member-agreement">PUB6</a>]. The Patent
      Policy <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C Patent
        Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>] is incorporated by
      normative reference as a part of the Process Document, and is thus equally
      binding.</p>
    <p>The Patent Policy places additional obligations on Members, Team, and
      other participants in W3C. The Process Document does not restate those
      requirements but includes references to them. The Process Document and
      Patent Policy have been designed so that they may evolve independently.</p>
    <p>In the Process Document, the term "participant" refers to an individual,
      not an organization.</p>

      <h2>1 <a id="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
      <p>Most W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies.
        To accomplish this work, W3C follows processes that promote the
        development of high-quality standards based on the <a href="#Consensus">consensus</a>
        of the Membership, Team, and public. W3C processes promote fairness,
        responsiveness, and progress: all facets of the W3C mission. This
        document describes the processes W3C follows in pursuit of its mission.</p>
      <p>Here is a general overview of how W3C standardizes a Web technology. In
        many cases, the goal of this work is a <a href="#RecsW3C">W3C
          Recommendation</a>, the W3C equivalent of a Web standard.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>People generate interest in a particular topic (e.g., Web services).
          For instance, Members express interest in the form of <a href="#Submission">Member
            Submissions</a>, and the <a href="#Team">Team</a> monitors work
          inside and outside of W3C for signs of interest. Also, W3C is likely
          to organize a <a href="#GAEvents">Workshop</a> to bring people
          together to discuss topics that interest the W3C community. This was
          the case, for example, with Web services.</li>
        <li>When there is enough interest in a topic (e.g., after a successful
          Workshop and/or discussion on an <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory
            Committee mailing list</a>), the Director announces the <a href="#ActivityDevelopment">development
            of a proposal for a new Activity</a> or <a href="#WGCharterDevelopment">Working
            Group charter</a>, depending on the breadth of the topic of
          interest. An <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity Proposal</a>
          describes the scope, duration, and other characteristics of the
          intended work, and includes the charters of one or more <a href="#GAGeneral">Working
            Groups, Interest Groups, and possibly Coordination Groups</a> to
          carry out the work. W3C Members <a href="#ActivityCreation">review
            each Activity Proposal</a> and the associated Working Group
          charters. When there is support within W3C for investing resources in
          the topic of interest, the Director approves the new Activity and
          groups get down to work. For the Web Services Activity, the initial
          Activity Proposal called for one Working Group to work on Web Services
          Architecture and one to work on a language for Web Services
          Description. The Activity Proposal also incorporated an existing
          Working Group (from another Activity) working on XML Protocols.</li>
        <li>There are three types of Working Group participants: <a href="#member-rep">Member
            representatives</a>, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Experts</a>,
          and <a href="#Team">Team representatives</a>. Team representatives
          both contribute to the technical work and help ensure the group's
          proper integration with the rest of W3C. The <a href="#WGCharter">Working
            Group charter</a> sets expectations about each group's deliverables
          (e.g., <a href="#Reports">technical reports</a>, test suites, and
          tutorials).</li>
        <li>Working Groups generally create specifications and guidelines that
          undergo cycles of revision and review as they <a href="#rec-advance">advance
            to W3C Recommendation</a> status. The W3C process for producing
          these technical reports includes significant review by the Members and
          public, and requirements that the Working Group be able to show
          implementation and interoperability experience. At the end of the
          process, the Advisory Committee reviews the mature technical report,
          and if there is support, W3C publishes it as a <a href="#RecsW3C">Recommendation</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Process Document promotes the goals of quality and fairness in
        technical decisions by encouraging <a href="#Consensus">consensus</a>,
        requiring reviews (by both Members and public) as part of the <a href="#Reports">technical
          report development process</a>, and through an <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal
          process</a> for the Advisory Committee.</p>
      <p>The other sections of the Process Document:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>set forth <a href="#Policies">policies</a> for participation in W3C
          groups,</li>
        <li>establish two permanent groups within W3C: the <a href="#TAG">Technical
            Architecture Group (TAG)</a>, to help resolve Consortium-wide
          technical issues; and the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board (AB)</a>, to
          help resolve Consortium-wide non-technical issues, and to manage the <a
            href="#GAProcess">evolution of the W3C process</a>, and</li>
        <li>describe other interactions between the <a href="#Members">Members</a>
          (as represented by the <a href="#AC">W3C Advisory Committee</a>), the
          Team, and the general public.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>2 <a id="Organization">Members, Advisory Committee, Team, Advisory
          Board, Technical Architecture Group</a></h2>
      <p>W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential. W3C <a href="#Members">Member</a>
        organizations provide resources to this end, and the W3C <a href="#Team">Team</a>
        provides the technical leadership and organization to coordinate the
        effort.</p>
      <h3>2.1 <a id="Members">Members</a></h3>
      <p>W3C Members are primarily represented in W3C processes as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a> is composed of one
          representative from each Member organization (refer to the <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>

                Architecture Group</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          Advisory Committee representatives have <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a>
          powers for some processes described in this document.</li>
        <li>Representatives of Member organizations participate in <a href="#GAGeneral">Working
            Groups, Interest Groups, and Coordination Groups</a> and author and
          review <a href="#Reports">technical reports</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><a id="MemberSubscription">W3C membership</a> is open to all entities,

        receives preferential treatment within W3C.</p>
      <p><a id="IndividualParticipation">W3C does not have a class of membership
          tailored to, or priced for individuals</a>. However, an individual <span

        case the same restrictions pertaining to <a href="#MemberRelated">related
          Members</a> apply when the individual also <a href="#member-rep">represents</a>
        another W3C Member.</p>
      <h4>2.1.1 <a id="MemberBenefits">Rights of Members</a></h4>
      <p>Each Member organization enjoys the following rights and benefits:</p>

        <li>Access to <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> information;</li>
        <li>The <a href="#Submission">Member Submission</a> process;</li>
        <li>Use of the W3C Member logo on promotional material and to publicize
          the Member's participation in W3C. For more information, please refer
          to the Member logo usage policy described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
Member
            Orientation</a> [<a href="#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, representatives of Member organizations participate in W3C
        as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In <a href="#GAGeneral">Working Groups, Interest Groups, and
            Coordination Groups</a>.</li>
        <li>In <a href="#GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a>;</li>
        <li>On the Team, as <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellows</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the case (described in paragraph 5g of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
          Agreement</a>), where a Member organization is itself a consortium,
        user society, or otherwise has members or sponsors, the organization's
        paid staff and Advisory Committee representative exercise all the rights
        and privileges of W3C membership. In addition, the Advisory Committee
        representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate up to four
        (or more at the Team's discretion) individuals who, though not employed
        by the organization, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> exercise the
        rights of <a href="#member-rep">Member representatives</a>. These
        individuals <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose their employment
        affiliation when participating in W3C work. Provisions for <a href="#MemberRelated">related
          Members</a> apply. Furthermore, these individuals are expected to
        represent the broad interests of the W3C Member organization and not the
        parochial interests of their employers.</p>
      <p>The rights and benefits of W3C membership are contingent upon
        conformance to the processes described in this document. The vast
        majority of W3C Members faithfully follow the spirit as well as the
        letter of these processes. When serious and/or repeated violations do
        occur, and repeated attempts to address these violations have not
        resolved the situation, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        take disciplinary action. Arbitration in the case of further
        disagreement is governed by paragraph 19 of the Membership Agreement.

      <h4>2.1.2 <a id="MemberRelated">Related Members</a></h4>
      <p>In the interest of ensuring the integrity of the consensus process,
        Member involvement in some of the processes in this document is affected
        by related Member status. As used herein, two Members are related if:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Either Member is a subsidiary of the other, or</li>
        <li>Both Members are subsidiaries of a common entity, or</li>
        <li>The Members have an employment contract or consulting contract that
          affects W3C participation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A <em>subsidiary</em> is an organization of which effective control
        and/or majority ownership rests with another, single organization.</p>
      <p>Related Members <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose these
        relationships according to the mechanisms described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
          Member Orientation</a> [<a href="#ref-new-member">MEM4</a>].</p>
      <h4>2.1.3 <a id="AC">Advisory Committee (AC)</a></h4>
      <p>When an organization joins W3C (see "<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/join">How
          to Join W3C</a>" [<a href="#ref-join-w3c">PUB5</a>]), it <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        name its Advisory Committee representative as part of the Membership
        Agreement. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New Member
          Orientation</a> explains how to subscribe or unsubscribe to Advisory
        Committee mailing lists, provides information about Advisory Committee

        and more. Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        follow the <a href="#coi">conflict of interest policy</a> by disclosing
        information according to the mechanisms described in the New Member
        Orientation. See also the additional roles of Advisory Committee
        representatives described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C

      <h5>2.1.3.1 <a id="ACCommunication">Advisory Committee Mailing Lists</a></h5>
      <p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two mailing lists
        for use by the Advisory Committee:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>One for official announcements (e.g., those required by this
          document) from the Team to the Advisory Committee. This list is
          read-only for Advisory Committee representatives.</li>
        <li>One for discussion among Advisory Committee representatives. Though
          this list is primarily for Advisory Committee representatives, the
          Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> monitor discussion and <span
            class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> participate in discussion when
          appropriate. Ongoing detailed discussions <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
          be moved to other appropriate lists (new or existing, such as a
          mailing list created for a <a href="#GAEvents">Workshop</a>).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>An Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        request that additional individuals from their organization be
        subscribed to these lists. Failure to contain distribution internally <span
          class="rfc2119">MAY</span> result in suspension of additional email
        addresses, at the discretion of the Team.</p>
      <h5>2.1.3.2 <a id="ACMeetings">Advisory Committee Meetings</a></h5>
      <p>The Team organizes a <a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a>
        for the Advisory Committee <span class="time-interval">twice a year</span>.
        The Team appoints the Chair of these meetings (generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair">W3C
          Chair</a> or <a href="#def-COO">Chief Operating Officer</a>). At each
        Advisory Committee meeting, the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>

      <p>The Team consists of the W3C paid staff, unpaid interns, and W3C
        Fellows. <a id="fellows">W3C Fellows</a> are Member employees working
        as part of the Team; see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows">W3C
          Fellows Program</a> [<a href="#ref-fellows">PUB32</a>]. The Team
        provides technical leadership about Web technologies, organizes and
        manages W3C Activities to reach goals within practical constraints (such
        as resources available), and communicates with the Members and the
        public about the Web and W3C technologies.</p>
      <p>The Team is led by the Director, W3C Chair, and Chief Operating
        Officer. These individuals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> delegate
        responsibility (generally to other individuals in the Team) for any of

      <h3>2.3 <a id="AB">Advisory Board (AB)</a></h3>
      <p>Created in March 1998, the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to
        the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and
        conflict resolution. The Advisory Board also serves the Members by
        tracking issues raised between Advisory Committee meetings, soliciting
        Member comments on such issues, and proposing actions to resolve these
        issues. The Advisory Board manages the <a href="#GAProcess">evolution
          of the Process Document</a>. The Advisory Board hears appeals of <a href="#SubmissionNo">Member
          Submission requests</a> that are rejected for reasons unrelated to Web
        architecture; see also the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>.</p>
      <p>The Advisory Board is <strong>not</strong> a board of directors and
        has no decision-making authority within W3C; its role is strictly
        advisory.</p>
      <p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available a mailing
        list for the Advisory Board to use for its communication, confidential
        to the Advisory Board and Team.</p>
      <p>The Advisory Board <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary

      <h4>2.3.1 <a id="ABParticipation">Advisory Board Participation</a></h4>
      <p>The Advisory Board consists of nine elected participants and a Chair.
        The Team appoints the Chair of the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>,
        who is generally the <a href="#def-W3CChair">W3C Chair</a>.</p>
      <p>The remaining nine Advisory Board participants are elected by the W3C
        Advisory Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG
          nomination and election process</a>.</p>
      <p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all Advisory Board
        participants are for <span class="time-interval">two years</span>.
        Terms are staggered so that each year, either four or five terms expire.
        If an individual is elected to fill an incomplete term, that
        individual's term ends at the normal expiration date of that term.
        Regular Advisory Board terms begin on 1 July and end on 30 June.</p>
      <h3>2.4 <a id="TAG">Technical Architecture Group (TAG)</a></h3>
      <p>Created in February 2001, the mission of the TAG is stewardship of the
        Web architecture. There are three aspects to this mission:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>to document and build consensus around principles of Web
          architecture and to interpret and clarify these principles when
          necessary;</li>
        <li>to resolve issues involving general Web architecture brought to the
          TAG;</li>
        <li>to help coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside
          and outside W3C.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The TAG hears appeals of <a href="#SubmissionNo">Member Submission
          requests</a> that are rejected for reasons related to Web
        architecture; see also the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</p>
      <p>The TAG's scope is limited to technical issues about Web architecture.
        The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> consider
        administrative, process, or organizational policy issues of W3C, which
        are generally addressed by the W3C Advisory Committee, Advisory Board,
        and Team. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag">TAG
          charter</a> [<a href="#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] for more
        information about the background and scope of the TAG, and the expected
        qualifications of TAG participants.</p>
      <p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> make available two mailing
        lists for the TAG:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a public discussion (not just input) list for issues of Web
          architecture. The TAG will conduct its public business on this list.</li>
        <li>a <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> list for discussions
          within the TAG and for requests to the TAG that, for whatever reason,
          cannot be made on the public list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also request the creation of
        additional topic-specific, public mailing lists. For some TAG
        discussions (e.g., an appeal of a <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected
          Member Submission request</a>), the TAG <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        use a list that will be <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>.</p>
      <p>The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> send a summary of each of
        its <a href="#GeneralMeetings">meetings</a> to the Advisory Committee
        and other group Chairs. The TAG <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        also report on its activities at each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory
          Committee meeting</a>.</p>
      <p>When the TAG votes to resolve an issue, each TAG participant (whether
        appointed, elected, or the Chair) has one vote; see also the section on
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/07/19-tag#Voting">voting in the TAG
          charter</a> [<a href="#ref-tag-charter">PUB25</a>] and the general
        section on <a href="#Votes">votes</a> in this Process Document.</p>
      <p>Details about the TAG (e.g., the list of TAG participants, mailing list
        information, and summaries of TAG meetings) are available at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/">TAG

      <h4>2.4.1 <a id="tag-participation">Technical Architecture Group
          Participation</a></h4>
      <p>The TAG consists of eight elected or appointed participants and a
        Chair. The Team appoints the Chair of the TAG, who is generally the <a
          href="#def-Director">Director</a>.</p>
      <p>Three TAG participants are appointed by the Director. Appointees are <span
          class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to be on the W3C Team. The
        Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appoint <a href="#fellows">W3C
          Fellows</a> to the TAG.</p>
      <p>The remaining five TAG participants are elected by the W3C Advisory
        Committee following the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination
          and election process</a>.</p>
      <p>With the exception of the Chair, the terms of all TAG participants are
        for <span class="time-interval">two years</span>. Terms are staggered
        so that each year, either two or three elected terms, and either one or
        two appointed terms expire. If an individual is appointed or elected to
        fill an incomplete term, that individual's term ends at the normal
        expiration date of that term. Regular TAG terms begin on 1 February and
        end on 31 January.</p>
      <h3>2.5 <a id="AB-TAG-participation">Advisory Board and Technical
          Architecture Group Participation</a></h3>
      <p>Advisory Board and TAG participants have a special role within W3C:
        they are elected by the Membership and appointed by the Director with
        the expectation that they will use their best judgment to find the best
        solutions for the Web, not just for any particular network, technology,
        vendor, or user. Advisory Board and TAG participants are expected to
        participate regularly and fully. <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>
        rules as defined for Working Group participants also apply to Advisory
        Board and TAG participants. Advisory Board and TAG participants <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        attend <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meetings</a>.</p>
      <p>An individual participates on the Advisory Board or TAG from the moment
        the individual's term begins until the term ends or the seat is <a href="#AB-TAG-vacated">vacated</a>.
        Although Advisory Board and TAG participants do not advocate for the
        commercial interests of their employers, their participation does carry
        the responsibilities associated with Member representation, Invited
        Expert status, or Team representation (as described in the section on
        the <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">AB/TAG nomination and election process</a>).

      <h4>2.5.1 <a id="AB-TAG-constraints">Advisory Board and Technical
          Architecture Group Participation Constraints</a></h4>
      <p>Given the few seats available on the Advisory Board and the TAG, and in
        order to ensure that the diversity of W3C Members is represented:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the
          TAG.</li>
        <li>A Member organization is permitted at most one participant on the

      </ul>
      <p>If, for whatever reason, these constraints are not satisfied (e.g.,
        because a TAG or AB participant changes jobs), one participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        cease TAG or AB participation until the situation has been resolved. If
        after <span class="time-interval">30 days</span> the situation has not
        been resolved, the Chair will declare one participant's seat to be
        vacant. When more than one individual is involved, the <a href="#random">verifiable
          random selection procedure</a> described below will be used to choose
        one person for continued participation.</p>
      <h4>2.5.2 <a id="AB-TAG-elections">Advisory Board and Technical
          Architecture Group Elections</a></h4>
      <p>The Advisory Board and a portion of the Technical Architecture Group
        are elected by the Advisory Committee. An election begins when the Team
        sends a Call for Nominations to the Advisory Committee. Any Call for
        Nominations specifies the number of available seats, the deadline for
        nominations, and the address where nominations are sent. The Director <span
          class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> announce appointments no later than the
        start of a nomination period, and generally as part of the Call for
        Nominations.</p>
      <p>Each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>)
        <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> nominate one individual. A nomination <span
          class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be made with the consent of the nominee.
        In order for an individual to be nominated as a Member representative,
        the individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> qualify for <a href="#member-rep">Member
          representation</a> and the Member's Advisory Committee representative
        <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include in the nomination the (same) <a
          href="#member-rep-info">information required for a Member
          representative in a Working Group</a>. In order for an individual to
        be nominated as an Invited Expert, the individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        provide the (same) <a href="#inv-expert-info">information required for
          an Invited Expert in a Working Group</a> and the nominating Advisory
        Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include that
        information in the nomination. In order for an individual to be
        nominated as a Team representative, the nominating Advisory Committee
        representative <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> first secure approval
        from Team management. A nominee is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span>
        to be an employee of a Member organization, and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        be a <a href="#fellows">W3C Fellow</a>. Each nomination <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        include a few informative paragraphs about the nominee.</p>
      <p>If, after the deadline for nominations, the number of nominees is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equal to the number of available seats, those nominees are thereby
          elected. This situation constitutes a tie for the purposes of
          assigning <a href="#short-term">short terms</a>.</li>
        <li>Less than the number of available seats, Calls for Nominations are
          issued until a sufficient number of people have been nominated. Those
          already nominated do not need to be renominated after a renewed call.</li>
        <li>Greater than the number of available seats, the Team issues a Call
          for Votes that includes the names of all candidates, the number of
          available seats, the deadline for votes, and the address where votes
          are sent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When there is a vote, each Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related
          Members</a>) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote for as many
        candidates as there are available seats; see the section on <a href="#ACVotes">Advisory
          Committee votes</a>. Once the deadline for votes has passed, the Team
        announces the results to the Advisory Committee. The candidates with the
        most votes are elected to the available seats. In case of a tie where
        there are more apparent winners than available seats (e.g., three
        candidates receive 10 votes each for two seats), the <a href="#random">verifiable
          random selection procedure</a> described below will be used to fill
        the available seats.</p>
      <p id="short-term">The shortest term is assigned to the elected individual
        who received the fewest votes, the next shortest to the elected
        individual who received the next fewest, and so on. In the case of a tie
        among those eligible for a short term, the <a href="#random">verifiable
          random selection procedure</a> described below will be used to assign
        the short term.</p>
      <p>Refer to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/10/election-howto">How to
          Organize an Advisory Board or TAG election</a> [<a href="#ref-election-howto">MEM15</a>]
        for more details.</p>
      <h5>2.5.2.1 <a id="random">Verifiable Random Selection Procedure</a></h5>
      <p>When it is necessary to use a verifiable random selection process
        (e.g., in an AB or TAG election, to "draw straws" in case of a tie or to
        fill a short term), W3C uses the random and verifiable procedure defined
        in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2777.txt">RFC 2777</a> [<a href="#ref-RFC2777">RFC2777</a>].
        The procedure orders an input list of names (listed in alphabetical
        order by family name unless otherwise specified) into a "result order."</p>
      <p>W3C applies this procedure as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>When N people have tied for M (less than N) seats. In this case,
          only the names of the N individuals who tied are provided as input to
          the procedure. The M seats are assigned in result order.</li>
        <li>After all elected individuals have been identified, when N people
          are eligible for M (less than N) short terms. In this case, only the
          names of those N individuals are provided as input to the procedure.
          The short terms are assigned in result order.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>2.5.3 <a id="AB-TAG-vacated">Advisory Board and Technical
          Architecture Group Vacated Seats</a></h4>
      <p>An Advisory Board or TAG participant's seat is vacated when either of
        the following occurs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the participant <a href="#resignation">resigns</a>, or</li>
        <li>the Chair asks the participant to <a href="#resignation">resign</a>,
          for example because the participant has failed to remain in <a href="#good-standing">Good
            Standing</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When an Advisory Board or TAG participant changes affiliations, as long
        as <a href="#AB-TAG-constraints">Advisory Board and TAG participation
          constraints</a> are respected, the individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        continue to participate until the next regularly scheduled election for
        that group. Otherwise, the seat is vacated.</p>
      <p>Vacated seats are filled according to this schedule:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When an appointed TAG seat is vacated, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
          re-appoint someone immediately, but no later than the next regularly
          scheduled election.</li>
        <li>When an elected seat on either the AB or TAG is vacated, the seat is
          filled at the next regularly scheduled election for the group unless
          the group Chair requests that W3C hold an election before then (for
          instance, due to the group's workload). The group Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD

      <h2>3 <a id="Policies">General Policies for W3C Groups</a></h2>
      <p>This section describes general policies for W3C groups regarding
        participation, meeting requirements, and decision-making. These policies
        apply to <a id="participant">participants</a> in the following groups:
        <a href="#AC">Advisory Committee</a>, <a href="#ABParticipation">Advisory
          Board</a>, <a href="#tag-participation">TAG</a>, <a href="#wgparticipant">Working
          Groups</a>, <a href="#igparticipant">Interest Groups</a>, and <a href="#cgparticipant">Coordination
          Groups</a>.</p>
      <h3>3.1 <a id="ParticipationCriteria">Individual Participation Criteria</a></h3>
      <p>There are three qualities an individual is expected to demonstrate in
        order to participate in W3C:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Technical competence in one's role</li>
        <li>The ability to act fairly</li>
        <li>Social competence in one's role</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Advisory Committee representatives who nominate individuals from their
        organization for participation in W3C Activities are responsible for
        assessing and attesting to the qualities of those nominees.</p>
      <p>See also the participation requirements described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-Disclosure">section
          6</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
          Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
      <h4>3.1.1 <a id="coi">Conflict of Interest Policy</a></h4>
      <p>Individuals participating materially in W3C work <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        disclose significant relationships when those relationships might
        reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest with the
        individual's role at W3C. These disclosures <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        be kept up-to-date as the individual's affiliations change and W3C
        membership evolves (since, for example, the individual might have a
        relationship with an organization that joins or leaves W3C). Each
        section in this document that describes a W3C group provides more detail
        about the disclosure mechanisms for that group.</p>
      <p>The ability of an individual to fulfill a role within a group without
        risking a conflict of interest is clearly a function of the individual's
        affiliations. When these affiliations change, the individual's
        assignment to the role <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be evaluated.
        The role <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be reassigned according to
        the appropriate process. For instance, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        appoint a new group Chair when the current Chair changes affiliations
        (e.g., if there is a risk of conflict of interest, or if there is risk
        that the Chair's new employer will be over-represented within a W3C
        Activity).</p>
      <p>The following are some scenarios where disclosure is appropriate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Paid consulting for an organization whose activity is relevant to
          W3C, or any consulting compensated with equity (shares of stock, stock
          options, or other forms of corporate equity).</li>
        <li>A decision-making role/responsibility (such as participating on the
          Board) in other organizations relevant to W3C.</li>
        <li>A position on a publicly visible advisory body, even if no decision
          making authority is involved.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Individuals seeking assistance on these matters <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        contact the Team.</p>
      <p>Team members are subject to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/06-conflictpolicy">W3C
          Team conflict of interest policy</a> [<a href="#ref-coi">PUB23</a>].</p>
      <h4>3.1.2 <a id="member-rep">Individuals Representing a Member
          Organization</a></h4>
      <p>Generally, individuals representing a Member in an official capacity
        within W3C are employees of the Member organization. However, an
        Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        designate a non-employee to represent the Member. Non-employee Member
        representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> disclose relevant
        affiliations to the Team and to any group in which the individual
        participates.</p>
      <p>In exceptional circumstances (e.g., situations that might jeopardize
        the progress of a group or create a <a href="#coi">conflict of interest</a>),
        the <a href="#def-Director">Director</a> <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        decline to allow an individual designated by an Advisory Committee
        representative to participate in a group.</p>
      <p>A group charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> limit the number of
        individuals representing a W3C Member (or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related
          Members</a>).</p>
      <h3>3.2 <a id="GeneralMeetings">Meetings</a></h3>
      <p>W3C groups (including the <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee</a>,
        <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>, <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>, and <a href="#GroupsWG">Working
          Groups</a>) <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> observe the meeting
        requirements in this section.</p>
      <p>W3C distinguishes two types of meetings:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A <a id="ftf-meeting">face-to-face meeting</a> is one where most of
          the attendees are expected to participate in the same physical
          location.</li>
        <li>A <a id="distributed-meeting">distributed meeting</a> is one where
          most of the attendees are expected to participate from remote
          locations (e.g., by telephone, video conferencing, or <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr>).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> invite an individual with a
        particular expertise to attend a meeting on an exceptional basis. This
        person is a meeting guest, not a group <a href="#participant">participant</a>.
        Meeting guests do not have <a href="#Votes">voting rights</a>. It is
        the responsibility of the Chair to ensure that all meeting guests
        respect the chartered <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level of

      <p>Meeting announcements <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be sent to
        all appropriate group mailing lists, i.e., those most relevant to the

      <p><sup>*</sup> To allow proper planning (e.g., travel arrangements), the
        Chair is responsible for giving sufficient advance notice about the date
        and location of a meeting. Shorter notice for a meeting is allowed
        provided that there are no objections from group participants.</p>
      <h3>3.3 <a id="Consensus">Consensus</a></h3>
      <p>Consensus is a core value of W3C. To promote consensus, the W3C process
        requires Chairs to ensure that groups consider all legitimate views and
        objections, and endeavor to resolve them, whether these views and
        objections are expressed by the active participants of the group or by
        others (e.g., another W3C group, a group in another organization, or the
        general public). Decisions <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made
        during meetings (<a href="#ftf-meeting">face-to-face</a> or <a href="#distributed-meeting">distributed</a>)
        as well as through email. <strong>Note:</strong> The Director, W3C
        Chair, and COO have the role of assessing consensus within the Advisory
        Committee.</p>
      <p>The following terms are used in this document to describe the level of
        support for a decision among a set of eligible individuals:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a id="def-Consensus">Consensus</a>: A substantial number of
          individuals in the set support the decision and nobody in the set
          registers a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>.
          Individuals in the set may abstain. Abstention is either an explicit
          expression of no opinion or silence by an individual in the set. <a id="def-Unanimity">Unanimity</a>
          is the particular case of consensus where all individuals in the set
          support the decision (i.e., no individual in the set abstains).</li>
        <li><a id="def-Dissent">Dissent</a>: At least one individual in the set
          registers a <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>By default, the set of individuals eligible to participate in a
        decision is the set of group participants in <a href="#good-standing">Good
          Standing</a>. The Process Document does not require a quorum for
        decisions (i.e., the minimal number of eligible participants required to
        be present before the Chair can call a question). A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        include a quorum requirement for consensus decisions.</p>
      <p>Where unanimity is not possible, a group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        strive to make consensus decisions where there is significant support
        and few abstentions. The Process Document does not require a particular
        percentage of eligible participants to agree to a motion in order for a
        decision to be made. To avoid decisions where there is widespread
        apathy, (i.e., little support and many abstentions), groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        set minimum thresholds of active support before a decision can be
        recorded. The appropriate percentage <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        vary depending on the size of the group and the nature of the decision.
        A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include threshold
        requirements for consensus decisions. For instance, a charter might
        require a supermajority of eligible participants (i.e., some established
        percentage above 50%) to support certain types of consensus decisions.</p>
      <h4>3.3.1 <a id="managing-dissent">Managing Dissent</a></h4>
      <p>In some cases, even after careful consideration of all points of view,
        a group might find itself unable to reach consensus. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        record a decision where there is dissent (i.e., there is at least one <a
          href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a>) so that the group may
        make progress (for example, to produce a deliverable in a timely
        manner). Dissenters cannot stop a group's work simply by saying that
        they cannot live with a decision. When the Chair believes that the Group
        has duly considered the legitimate concerns of dissenters as far as is
        possible and reasonable, the group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        move on.</p>
      <p>Groups <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> favor proposals that create
        the weakest objections. This is preferred over proposals that are
        supported by a large majority but that cause strong objections from a
        few people. As part of making a decision where there is dissent, the
        Chair is expected to be aware of which participants work for the same
        (or <a href="#MemberRelated">related</a>) Member organizations and
        weigh their input accordingly.</p>
      <h4>3.3.2 <a id="WGArchiveMinorityViews">Recording and Reporting Formal
          Objections</a></h4>
      <p>In the W3C process, an individual may register a Formal Objection to a
        decision. A <a id="FormalObjection">Formal Objection</a> to a group
        decision is one that the reviewer requests that the Director consider as
        part of evaluating the related decision (e.g., in response to a <a href="#rec-advance">request
          to advance</a> a technical report). <strong>Note:</strong> In this
        document, the term "Formal Objection" is used to emphasize this process
        implication: Formal Objections receive Director consideration. The word
        "objection" used alone has ordinary English connotations.</p>
      <p>An individual who registers a Formal Objection <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        cite technical arguments and propose changes that would remove the
        Formal Objection; these proposals <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be
        vague or incomplete. Formal Objections that do not provide substantive
        arguments or rationale are unlikely to receive serious consideration by
        the Director.</p>
      <p>A record of each Formal Objection <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
        <a href="#confidentiality-change">publicly available</a>. A Call for
        Review (of a document) to the Advisory Committee <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        identify any Formal Objections.</p>
      <h4>3.3.3 <a id="formal-address">Formally Addressing an Issue</a></h4>
      <p>In the context of this document, a group has formally addressed an
        issue when it has sent a public, substantive response to the reviewer
        who raised the issue. A substantive response is expected to include
        rationale for decisions (e.g., a technical explanation, a pointer to
        charter scope, or a pointer to a requirements document). The adequacy of
        a response is measured against what a W3C reviewer would generally
        consider to be technically sound. If a group believes that a reviewer's
        comments result from a misunderstanding, the group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        seek clarification before reaching a decision.</p>
      <p>As a courtesy, both Chairs and reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        set expectations for the schedule of responses and acknowledgments. The
        group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> reply to a reviewer's initial
        comments in a timely manner. The group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        set a time limit for acknowledgment by a reviewer of the group's
        substantive response; a reviewer cannot block a group's progress. It is
        common for a reviewer to require a week or more to acknowledge and
        comment on a substantive response. The group's responsibility to respond
        to reviewers does not end once a reasonable amount of time has elapsed.
        However, reviewers <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> realize that
        their comments will carry less weight if not sent to the group in a
        timely manner.</p>
      <p>Substantive responses <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be recorded.
        The group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> maintain an accurate
        summary of all substantive issues and responses to them (e.g., in the
        form of an issues list with links to mailing list archives).</p>
      <h4>3.3.4 <a id="WGChairReopen">Reopening a Decision When Presented With
          New Information</a></h4>
      <p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reopen a decision when
        presented with new information, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>additional technical information,</li>
        <li>comments by email from participants who were unable to attend a
          scheduled meeting,</li>
        <li>comments by email from meeting attendees who chose not to speak out
          during a meeting (e.g., so they could confer later with colleagues or
          for cultural reasons).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Chair <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> record that a decision
        has been reopened, and <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> do so upon
        request from a group participant.</p>
      <h3>3.4 <a id="Votes">Votes</a></h3>
      <p>A group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> only conduct a vote to
        resolve a <em>substantive issue</em> after the Chair has determined
        that all available means of <a href="#Consensus">reaching consensus</a>
        through technical discussion and compromise have failed, and that a vote
        is necessary to break a deadlock. In this case the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        record (e.g., in the minutes of the meeting or in an archived email
        message):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an explanation of the issue being voted on;</li>
        <li>the decision to conduct a vote (e.g., a simple majority vote) to
          resolve the issue;</li>
        <li>the outcome of the vote;</li>
        <li>any Formal Objections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order to vote to resolve a substantive issue, an individual <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        be a group <a href="#participant">participant</a> in <a href="#good-standing">Good
          Standing</a>. Each organization represented in the group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        have at most one vote, even when the organization is represented by
        several participants in the group (including Invited Experts). For the
        purposes of voting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A Member or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related Members</a>
          is considered a single organization.</li>
        <li>The <a href="#Team">Team</a> is considered an organization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unless the charter states otherwise, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited
          Experts</a> <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote.</p>
      <p>If a participant is unable to attend a vote, that individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        authorize anyone at the meeting to act as a <a id="proxy">proxy</a>.
        The absent participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the
        Chair in writing who is acting as proxy, with written instructions on
        the use of the proxy. For a Working Group or Interest Group, see the
        related requirements regarding an individual who attends a meeting as a
        <a href="#mtg-substitute">substitute</a> for a participant.</p>
      <p>A group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> vote for other purposes than
        to resolve a substantive issue. For instance, the Chair often conducts a
        "straw poll" vote as a means of determining whether there is consensus
        about a potential decision.</p>
      <p>A group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also vote to make a process
        decision. For example, it is appropriate to decide by simple majority
        whether to hold a meeting in San Francisco or San Jose (there's not much
        difference geographically). When simple majority votes are used to
        decide minor issues, the minority are <span class="rfc2119">NOT
          REQUIRED</span> to state the reasons for their dissent, and the group
        is <span class="rfc2119">NOT REQUIRED</span> to record individual
        votes.</p>
      <p>A group charter <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> include formal
        voting procedures (e.g., quorum or threshold requirements) for making
        decisions about substantive issues.</p>
      <p>Procedures for <a href="#ACVotes">Advisory Committee votes</a> are
        described separately.</p>
      <h3>3.5 <a id="WGAppeals">Appeal of a Chair's Decision</a></h3>
      <p>Groups resolve issues through dialog. Individuals who disagree strongly
        with a decision <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> register with the
        Chair any <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal Objections</a> (e.g., to a
        decision made as the result of a <a href="#Votes">vote</a>).</p>
      <p>When group participants believe that their concerns are not being duly

          with the general public (e.g., news services, press releases, managing
          the Web site and access privileges, and managing calendars). Members <span
            class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> solicit review by the Team prior to
          issuing press releases about their work within W3C.</p>
        <p>The Team makes every effort to ensure the persistence and
          availability of the following public information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#Reports">W3C technical reports</a> whose publication has
            been approved by the Director. Per the Membership Agreement, W3C
            technical reports (and software) are available free of charge to the
            general public; (refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C
              Document License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>]).</li>
          <li>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">mission
              statement</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>] that explains the
            purpose and mission of W3C, the key benefits for Members, and the
            organizational structure of W3C.</li>
          <li>Legal documents, including the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Agreement/Member-Agreement">Membership
              Agreement</a> [<a href="#ref-member-agreement">PUB6</a>]) and
            documentation of any legal commitments W3C has with other entities.</li>
          <li>The Process Document.</li>
          <li>Public results of W3C Activities and <a href="#GAEvents">Workshops</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To keep the Members abreast of W3C meetings, Workshops, and review
          deadlines, the Team provides them with a regular (e.g., weekly) news
          service and maintains a <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Eventscal">calendar</a>
          [<a href="#ref-calendar">MEM3</a>] of official W3C events. Members are
          encouraged to send schedule and event information to the Team for
          inclusion on this calendar.</p>
        <h3>4.1 <a id="confidentiality-levels">Confidentiality Levels</a></h3>
        <p>There are three principal levels of access to W3C information (on the
          W3C Web site, in W3C meetings, etc.): public, Member-only, and
          Team-only.</p>
        <p>While much information made available by W3C is public, <a id="Member-only">"Member-only"
            information</a> is available to authorized parties only, including
          representatives of Member organizations, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited
            Experts</a>, the Advisory Board, the TAG, and the Team. For example,
          the <a href="#WGCharter">charter</a> of some Working Groups may
          specify a Member-only confidentiality level for group proceedings.</p>
        <p><a id="Team-only">"Team-only" information</a> is available to the
          Team and other authorized parties.</p>
        <p>Those authorized to access Member-only and Team-only information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> treat the information as
            confidential within W3C,</li>
          <li><span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> use reasonable efforts to
            maintain the proper level confidentiality, and</li>
          <li><span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> release this information to
            the general public or press.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide mechanisms to
          protect the confidentiality of Member-only information and ensure that
          authorized parties have proper access to this information. Documents <span
            class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> clearly indicate whether they require
          Member-only confidentiality. Individuals uncertain of the
          confidentiality level of a piece of information <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
          contact the Team.</p>
        <p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
          authorize Member-only access to <a href="#member-rep">Member
            representatives</a> and other individuals employed by the Member who
          are considered appropriate recipients. For instance, it is the
          responsibility of the Advisory Committee representative and other
          employees and official representatives of the organization to ensure
          that Member-only news announcements are distributed for internal use
          only within their organization. Information about Member mailing lists
          is available in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
            Member Orientation</a>.</p>
        <h4>4.1.1 <a id="confidentiality-change">Changing Confidentiality Level</a></h4>
        <p>As a benefit of membership, W3C provides some Team-only and
          Member-only channels for certain types of communication. For example,
          Advisory Committee representatives can send <a href="#ACReview">reviews</a>
          to a Team-only channel. However, for W3C processes with a significant
          public component, such as the technical report development process, it
          is also important for information that affects decision-making to be
          publicly available. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> need to
          communicate Team-only information to a Working Group or the public.
          Similarly, a Working Group whose proceedings are Member-only <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
          make public information pertinent to the technical report development
          process.</p>
        <p>This document clearly indicates which information <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
          be available to Members or the public, even though that information
          was initially communicated on Team-only or Member-only channels. Only
          the Team and parties authorized by the Team change the level of
          confidentiality of this information. When doing so:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> use a version of the
            information that was expressly provided by the author for the new
            confidentiality level. In Calls for Review and other similar
            messages, the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> remind
            recipients to provide such alternatives.</li>
          <li>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> attribute the
            version for the new confidentiality level to the author without the
            author's consent.</li>
          <li>If the author has not conveyed to the Team a version that is
            suitable for another confidentiality level, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
            make available a version that reasonably communicates what is
            required, while respecting the original level of confidentiality,
            and without attribution to the original author.</li>

        <h2>5 Activities</h2>
        <p><em>This section is being removed, leaving internal management of
            work to W3C Team. In <strong>this</strong> draft, points not
            covered elsewhere and relevant beyond the structure of "Activites"
            have been left here, until there is a resolution on what to do about
            them.</em></p>
        <p>W3C starts an Activity based on interest from the Members and Team. <span
            class="issue">Should we move this to charters, or remove it as
            obvious?</span></p>
        <p>Based on input from the Team and Members about the structure and
          scope of an Activity, the Team sends an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity
            Proposal</a> to the Advisory Committee. This is a proposal to
          dedicate Team and Member resources to a particular area of Web
          technology or policy, and when there is consensus about the
          motivation, scope, and structure of the proposed work, W3C starts a
          new Activity. <span class="issue">Move this to cover charter
            development</span></p>
        <p>The progress of each Activity is documented in an Activity Statement.
          At least before each <a href="#ACMeetings">Advisory Committee meeting</a>,
          the Team <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> revise the Activity
          Statement for each Activity that has not been closed. <span class="issue">Should
            we put this requirement on charters?</span></p>
        <h3>5.2 Advisory Committee Review of an Activity Proposal</h3>
        <p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> solicit <a href="#ReviewAppeal">Advisory
            Committee review</a> of every proposal to create, substantively
          modify, or <strong>extend</strong> an Activity. <span class="issue"><strong></strong>currently
            charters can be extended without review - should that be changed?</span>
          The review period <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be at least <span
            class="time-interval">four weeks</span>. <span class="issue">Keep
            four week requirement for charter review (probably yes)?<br>
          </span></p>
        <p>The Director announces to the Advisory Committee whether there is
          consensus within W3C to create or modify the Activity (possibly with
          changes suggested during the review). For a new Activity, this
          announcement officially creates the Activity.&nbsp; <span class="issue">Move
            this to cover charter development</span></p>
        <p>If there was <a href="#def-Dissent">dissent</a>, Advisory Committee
          representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a>
          a decision to create, modify, or extend the Activity. <span class="issue">This
            is different from the equivalent for charters</span></p>
        <h3>5.6 Activity Proposals</h3>
        <p>An Activity Proposal defines the initial scope and structure of an
          Activity. The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include or
          reference the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Context information. Why is this Activity being proposed now? What
            is the situation in the world (e.g., with respect to the Web
            community, market, research, or society)? within the scope of the
            proposal? Who or what currently exists that is pertinent to this
            Activity? Is the community mature/growing/developing a niche? What
            competing technologies exist? What competing organizations exist? <span
              class="issue">For Activities the appeal required dissent in the
              review. Should we have that constraint?</span></li>
          <li>A description of the Activity's scope. How might a potential
            Recommendation interact and overlap with existing international
            standards and Recommendations? What organizations are likely to be
            affected by potential overlap (see the section on <a href="#Liaisons">liaisons
              with other organizations</a>)? What should be changed if the
            Activity is approved? <span class="issue">Do we need this info
              beyond the dependency information already required?</span></li>
          <li>The proposal <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> specify the
            threshold level of effort that Members are expected to pledge in
            order for the Activity to be accepted. <span class="issue">The team
              adopted a best practice to do this</span></li>
          <li>Intellectual property information. What are the intellectual
            property (including patents and copyright) considerations affecting
            the success of the Activity? In particular, is there any reason to
            believe that it will be difficult to meet the Royalty-Free licensing
            goals of section 2 of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
              Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>]? <span
              class="issue">Should we put this requirement on charters?</span></li>
          <li>A list of supporters and references. What community is expected to
            benefit from this Activity? Are members of this community part of
            W3C now? Are they expected to join the effort? <span class="issue">Should
              we put this requirement on charters?</span></li>

        <ol>
          <li><a href="#GroupsWG">Working Groups.</a> Working Groups typically
            produce deliverables (e.g., <a href="#rec-advance">Recommendation
              Track technical reports</a>, software, test suites, and reviews of
            the deliverables of other groups). There are <a href="#good-standing">Good

            as additional participation requirements described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
              Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</li>
          <li><a href="#GroupsIG">Interest Groups.</a> The primary goal of an
            Interest Group is to bring together people who wish to evaluate
            potential Web technologies and policies. An Interest Group is a
            forum for the exchange of ideas.</li>
          <li><a href="#GroupsCG">Coordination Groups.</a> A Coordination Group
            manages dependencies and facilitates communication with other
            groups, within or outside of W3C.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Neither Interest Groups nor Coordination Groups publish <a href="#RecsW3C">Recommendation
            Track technical reports</a>; see information about <a href="#WGNote">maturity
            levels for Interest Groups and Coordination Groups</a>.</p>
        <h3>6.1 <a id="ReqsAllGroups">Requirements for All Working, Interest,
            and Coordination Groups</a></h3>
        <p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a charter.
          Requirements for the charter depend on the group type. All group
          charters <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be public (even if other
          proceedings of the group are <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a>).
          Existing charters that are not yet public <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
          be made public when next revised or extended (with attention to <a href="#confidentiality-change">changing
            confidentiality level</a>).</p>
        <p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a <a id="GeneralChairs">Chair</a>
          (or co-Chairs) to coordinate the group's tasks. The Director appoints
          (and re-appoints) Chairs for all groups. The Chair is a <a href="#member-rep">Member
            representative</a>, a <a href="#Team">Team representative</a>, or
          an <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Expert</a> (invited by the
          Director). The requirements of this document that apply to those types
          of participants apply to Chairs as well. The <a href="/Guide/chair-roles">role
            of the Chair [MEM14]</a> is described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/">Member
            guide</a> [<a href="#ref-guide">MEM9</a>].</p>
        <p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have a <a id="TeamContact">Team
            Contact</a>, who acts as the interface between the Chair, group
          participants, and the rest of the Team. The <a href="/Guide/staff-contact">role
            of the Team Contact</a> is described in the Member guide. The Chair
          and the Team Contact of a group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span>
          be the same individual.</p>
        <p>Each group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> have an archived
          mailing list for formal group communication (e.g., for meeting
          announcements and minutes, documentation of decisions, and <a href="#FormalObjection">Formal
            Objections</a> to decisions). It is the responsibility of the Chair
          and Team Contact to ensure that new participants are subscribed to all
          relevant mailing lists. Refer to the list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Mail/">group
mailing
            lists</a> [<a href="#ref-mailing-lists">MEM2</a>].</p>
        <p>A Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> form task forces (composed
          of group participants) to carry out assignments for the group. The
          scope of these assignments <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span>
          exceed the scope of the group's charter. A group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
          document the process it uses to create task forces (e.g., each task
          force might have an informal "charter"). Task forces do not publish <a

          choose to publish their results as part of a technical report.</p>
        <h3>6.2 <a id="GroupsWG">Working Groups</a> and <a id="GroupsIG">Interest
            Groups</a></h3>
        <p>Although Working Groups and Interest Groups have different purposes,
          they share some characteristics, and so are defined together in the
          following sections.</p>
        <h4>6.2.1 <a id="group-participation">Working Group and Interest Group
            Participation Requirements</a></h4>
        <p>There are three types of individual <a id="wgparticipant">participants
            in a Working Group</a>: <a href="#member-rep">Member
            representatives</a>, <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Experts</a>,
          and <a href="#Team">Team representatives</a> (including the <a href="#TeamContact">Team
            Contact</a>).</p>
        <p>There are four types of individual <a id="igparticipant">participants
            in an Interest Group</a>: the same three types as for Working Groups
          plus, for an Interest Group where the only <a href="#ig-mail-only">participation
            requirement is mailing list subscription</a>, <a id="public-participant-ig">public
            participants</a>.</p>
        <p>Except where noted in this document or in a group charter, all
          participants share the same rights and responsibilities in a group;
          see also the <a href="#ParticipationCriteria">individual
            participation criteria</a>.</p>
        <p>A participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> represent at most
          one organization in a Working Group or Interest Group.</p>
        <p>An individual <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> become a Working or
          Interest Group participant at any time during the group's existence.
          See also relevant requirements in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-join">section
            4.3</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
            Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
        <p>On an exceptional basis, a Working or Interest Group participant <span
            class="rfc2119">MAY</span> designate a <a id="mtg-substitute">substitute</a>
          to attend a <a href="#GeneralMeetings">meeting</a> and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
          inform the Chair. The substitute <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> act
          on behalf of the participant, including for <a href="#Votes">votes</a>.
          For the substitute to vote, the participant <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
          inform the Chair in writing in advance. As a courtesy to the group, if
          the substitute is not well-versed in the group's discussions, the
          regular participant <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> authorize
          another participant to act as <a href="#proxy">proxy</a> for votes.
          For the purposes of <a href="#good-standing">Good Standing</a>, the
          regular representative and the substitute are considered the same
          participant.</p>
        <p>To allow rapid progress, Working Groups are intended to be small
          (typically fewer than 15 people) and composed of experts in the area
          defined by the charter. In principle, Interest Groups have no limit on
          the number of participants. When a Working Group grows too large to be
          effective, W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> split it into an
          Interest Group (a discussion forum) and a much smaller Working Group
          (a core group of highly dedicated participants).</p>

        <ul>
          <li>attending most meetings of the Working Group.</li>
          <li>providing deliverables or drafts of deliverables in a timely

          <li>being familiar with the relevant documents of the Working Group,
            including minutes of past meetings.</li>
          <li>following discussions on relevant mailing list(s).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the first Working Group meeting that follows any <a href="#cfp">Call
            for Participation</a>, all participants are in Good Standing. If a
          Member or Invited Expert joins the Working Group after the end of that
          meeting, the Member Representative or Invited Expert does not attain
          Good Standing until the start of the second consecutive meeting that
          individual attends.</p>
        <p>When the Chair and the <a href="#TeamContact">Team Contact</a>
          agree, the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> declare that a
          participant is no longer in Good Standing (henceforth called "Bad

          standing. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> declare a Team
          participant to be in Bad Standing, but it is clearly preferable for
          the Chair, Team participant, and W3C management to resolve issues
          internally.</p>
        <p>A participant <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be declared in Bad
          Standing in any of the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the individual has missed more than one of the last three <a href="#distributed-meeting">distributed

          <li>the individual has not provided deliverables in a timely fashion
            twice in sequence.</li>
          <li>the individual has not followed the <a href="#coi">conflict of

        </ul>
        <p>Although all participants representing an organization <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
          attend all meetings, attendance by one representative of an
          organization satisfies the meeting attendance requirement for all
          representatives of the organization.</p>
        <p>The above criteria <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be relaxed if
          the Chair and Team Contact agree that doing so will not set back the
          Working Group. For example, the attendance requirement can be relaxed
          for reasons of expense (e.g., cost of travel) or scheduling (for
          example, an exceptional teleconference is scheduled at 3:00 a.m. local
          time for the participant). It is the responsibility of the Chair and
          Team Contact to apply criteria for Good Standing consistently.</p>
        <p>When a participant risks losing Good Standing, the Chair and Team
          Contact are expected to discuss the matter with the participant and
          the participant's Advisory Committee representative (or W3C management
          for the Team) before declaring the participant in Bad Standing.</p>
        <p>The Chair declares a participant in Bad Standing by informing the
          participant's Advisory Committee representative and the participant of
          the decision. If the Advisory Committee representative and Chair
          differ in opinion, the Advisory Committee representative <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
          ask the <a href="#def-Director">Director</a> to confirm or deny the
          decision. <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Experts</a> declared
          in Bad Standing <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to the
          Director.</p>
        <p>The Chair and Team Contact restore Good Standing and <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
          do so when the individual in Bad Standing satisfies the above
          criteria. The Chair <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> inform the
          individual's Advisory Committee representative of any change in
          standing.</p>
        <p>When a Member representative permanently replaces another (i.e., is
          not simply a temporary <a href="#mtg-substitute">substitute</a>), the
          new participant inherits the standing of the departing participant.</p>
        <p>Changes in an individual's standing in a Working Group have no effect
          on the obligations associated with Working Group participation that
          are described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C

        <p>A charter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> include provisions other

        <h4>6.2.7 <a id="three-month-rule">Working Group "Heartbeat"
            Requirement</a></h4>
        <p>It is important that a Working Group keep the Membership and public
          informed of its activity and progress. To this end, each Working Group
          <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> publish in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C
            technical reports index</a> a new draft of <em>each active
            technical report</em> at least once every three months. An active
          technical report is a Working Draft, Candidate Recommendation,
          Proposed Recommendation, or Proposed Edited Recommendation. Each
          Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> publish a new draft
          of <em>at least one of its active technical reports</em> on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">W3C
            technical reports index</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-list">PUB11</a>] at
          least once every three months.</p>
        <p>Public progress reports are also important when a Working Group does
          not update a technical report within three months (for example, when
          the delay is due to a challenging technical issue) or when a Working
          Group has no active technical reports (for example, because it is
          developing a test suite).</p>
        <p>In exceptional cases, the Chair <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> ask
          the Director to be excused from this publication requirement. However,
          in this case, the Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
          issue a public status report with rationale why a new draft has not
          been published.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons for this Working Group "heartbeat"
          requirement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To promote public accountability;</li>
          <li>To encourage Working Groups to keep moving forward, and to
            incorporate their decisions into readable public documents. People
            cannot be expected to read several months of a group's mailing list
            archive to understand where the group stands;</li>
          <li>To notify interested parties of updated work in familiar a place
            such as the W3C home page and index of technical reports.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As an example, suppose a Working Group has one technical report as a
          deliverable, which it publishes as a Proposed Recommendation. Per the
          heartbeat requirement, the Working Group is required to publish a new
          draft of the Proposed Recommendation at least once every three months,
          even if it is only to revise the status of the Proposed Recommendation
          document (e.g., to provide an update on the status of the decision to
          advance). The heartbeat requirement stops when the document becomes a
          Recommendation (or a Working Group Note).</p>
        <h4>6.2.8 <a id="GeneralTermination">Working Group and Interest Group
            Closure</a></h4>
        <p>A Working Group or Interest Group charter specifies a duration for
          the group. The Director, subject to <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> by
          Advisory Committee representatives, <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
          close a group prior to the date specified in the charter in any of the
          following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are insufficient resources to produce chartered deliverables
            or to maintain the group, according to priorities established within
            W3C.</li>
          <li>The group produces chartered deliverables ahead of schedule.</li>
          <li>The Activity to which the group belongs terminates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Director closes a Working Group or Interest Group by announcement
          to the Advisory Committee.</p>
        <p>Closing a Working Group has implications with respect to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C
            Patent Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>].</p>
        <h3>6.3 <a id="GroupsCG">Coordination Groups</a></h3>
        <p>W3C Activities interact in many ways. There are dependencies between
          groups within the same Activity or in different Activities. There are
          also dependencies between W3C Activities and the activities of other
          organizations. Examples of dependencies include the use by one
          technology of another being developed elsewhere, scheduling
          constraints between groups, and the synchronization of publicity for
          the announcement of deliverables. Coordination Groups are created to
          manage dependencies so that issues are resolved fairly and the
          solutions are consistent with W3C's mission and results.</p>
        <p>Where a Coordination Group's scope covers two groups with unresolved
          disputes or tensions, it is the first locus of resolution of these
          disputes.</p>
        <h4>6.3.1 <a id="CGParticipation">Coordination Group Participation
            Requirements</a></h4>
        <p>There are four types <a id="cgparticipant">participants in a
            Coordination Group</a>: the <a href="#GeneralChairs">Chair</a>, the
          Chair of each coordinated group (to promote effective communication
          among the groups), Invited Experts (e.g., liaisons to groups inside or
          outside W3C), and Team representatives (including the <a href="#TeamContact">Team
            Contact</a>). The requirements for Invited Expert participation are
          the same as for an <a href="#invited-expert-wg">Invited Expert in a
            Working Group</a>.</p>
        <p>Coordination Group participants <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>

          disclosing information to the rest of the group.</p>
        <p>There are no Good Standing requirements for Coordination Group
          participation; regular participation in a relevant Coordination Group
          is one of the <a href="/Guide/chair-roles">roles of a group Chair

        <h4>6.3.2 <a id="CGCreation">Coordination Group Creation and Closure</a></h4>
        <p>The Director creates or modifies a Coordination Group by sending the
          <a href="#CGCharter">Coordination Group charter</a> to the Advisory

          (for example to coordinate other groups in the Activity or to draw up

          dependencies arise. A Coordination Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
          operate as part of several W3C Activities.</p>
        <p>A Coordination Group <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> close when

      <h3 id="rec-advance">7.1 W3C Technical Reports</h3>
      <p>Please note that <dfn>publishing</dfn> as used in this document refers
        to producing a version which is listed as a W3C Technical Report on its
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">Technical Reports page
          http://www.w3.org/TR</a>.</p>
      <p>This chapter describes the formal requirements for publishing and
        maintaining a W3C Recommendation or Note.</p>
      <p>Typically a series of Working Drafts are published, each of which
        refines a document under development to complete the scope of work
        envisioned by a Working Group's charter. For a technical specification,
        once review suggests the Working Group has met their requirements
        satisfactorily for a new standard, there is a Candidate Recommendation
        phase. This allows the entire W3C membership to provide feedback on
        whether the specification should become a W3C Recommendation, while the
        Working Group formally collects&nbsp; implementation experience to
        demonstrate that the specification works in practice. The next phase is
        a Proposed Recommendation, to finalize the review of W3C Members. If the
        Director determines that W3C member review supports a specification
        becoming a standard, W3C publishes it as a Recommendation.</p>
      <p>Groups may also publish documents as W3C Notes, typically either to
        document information other than technical specifications, such as use
        cases motivating a specification and best practices for its use, or to
        clarify the status of work that is abandoned. </p>
      <p>Some W3C Notes are developed through successive Working Drafts, with an
        expectation that they will become Notes, while others are simply
        published. There are few formal requirements to publish a document as a
        W3C Note, and they have no standing as a recommendation of W3C but are
        simply documents preserved for historical reference.</p>
      <p>Individual Working Groups and Interest Groups may adopt additional
        processes for developing publications, so long as they do not conflict
        with the requirements in this chapter.</p>

      <p>W3C follows these steps when advancing a technical report to

      </ul>
      <p>For a First Public Working Draft there is no "previous maturity level",
        so many requirements do not apply, and approval is normally fairly
        automatic. For later stages, especially transition to Candidate or
        Proposed Recommendation, there is generally a formal review meeting to
        ensure the requirements have been met before Director's approval is
        given.</p>
      <h4 id="doc-reviews">7.2.3 Reviews and Review Responsibilities</h4>
      <p>A document is available for review from the moment it is first
        published. Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em> <a href="#formal-address">formally
          address</a> <em>any</em> substantive review comment about a technical
        report in a timely manner. </p>
      Reviewers <em class="rfc2119">should</em> send substantive technical
      reviews as early as possible. Working Groups are often reluctant to make <a
        href="#substantive-change">substantive changes</a> to a mature document,
      particularly if this would cause significant compatibility problems due to
      existing implementation. Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">should</em>
      record substantive or interesting proposals raised by reviews but not
      incorporated into a current specification.
      <h5>7.2.3.1 <a id="wide-review">Wide Review</a></h5>
      <p>The requirements for <dfn>wide review</dfn> are not precisely defined
        by the W3C Process. The objective is to ensure that the entire set of
        stakeholders of the Web community, including the general public, have
        had adequate notice of the progress of the Working Group and thereby an
        opportunity to comment on the specification. Before approving
        transitions, the Director will consider who has been explicitly offered
        a reasonable opportunity to review the document, who has provided
        comments, the record of requests to and responses from reviewers,
        especially groups identified as dependencies in the charter, and seek
        evidence of clear communication to the general public about appropriate
        times and which content to review. </p>
      <p>For example, inviting review of new or significantly revised sections
        published in Working Drafts, and tracking those comments and the Working
        Group's responses, is generally a good practice which would often be
        considered positive evidence of wide review. Working Groups <span class="rfc2119">should</span>
        announce to other W3C Working Groups as well as the general public,
        especially those affected by this specification, a proposal to enter
        Candidate Recommendation (for example in approximately four weeks). By
        contrast a generic statement in a document requesting review at any time
        is likely not to be considered as sufficient evidence that the group has
        solicited wide review. </p>
      <p>A Working Group could present evidence that wide review has been
        received, irrespective of solicitation. But it is important to note that
        receiving many detailed reviews is not necessarily the same as wide
        review, since they may only represent comment from a small segment of
        the relevant stakeholder community.</p>
      <h4 id="implementation-experience">7.2.4 Implementation Experience</h4>
      <p>Implementation experience is required to show that a specification is
        sufficiently clear, complete, and relevant to market needs, to ensure
        that independent interoperable implementations of each feature of the
        specification will be realized. While no exhaustive list of requirements
        is provided here, when assessing that there is <dfn>adequate
          implementation experience</dfn> the Director will consider (though not
        be limited to):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>is each feature of the current specification implemented, and how is
          this demonstrated?</li>
        <li>are there independent interoperable implementations of the current
          specification?</li>
        <li>are there implementations created by people other than the authors
          of the specification?</li>
        <li>are implementations publicly deployed?</li>
        <li>is there implementation experience at all levels of the
          specification's ecosystem (authoring, consuming, publishing…)?</li>
        <li>are there reports of difficulties or problems with implementation?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Planning and accomplishing a demonstration of (interoperable)
        implementations can be very time consuming. Groups are often able to
        work more effectively if they plan how they will demonstrate
        interoperable implementations early in the development process; for
        example, they may wish to develop tests in concert with implementation
        efforts.</p>
      <h4 id="correction-classes">7.2.5 Classes of Changes</h4>
      <p>This document distinguishes the following 4 classes of changes to a
        specification. The first two classes of change are considered <dfn id="editorial-change">editorial

        <dd>Editorial changes or clarifications that do not change the technical

        <dd>These changes <span class="rfc2119">may</span> affect conformance
          to the specification. A change that affects conformance is one that:

            <li>makes conforming data, processors, or other conforming agents
              become non-conforming according to the new version, or</li>
            <li>makes non-conforming data, processors, or other agents become
              conforming, or</li>
            <li>clears up an ambiguity or under-specified part of the
              specification in such a way that data, a processor, or an agent
              whose conformance was once unclear becomes clearly either
              conforming or non-conforming.</li>

      <h4 id="errata">7.7.1 Errata Management</h4>
      <p>Tracking errors is an important part of a Working Group's ongoing care
        of a Recommendation; for this reason, the scope of a Working Group
        charter generally allows time for work after publication of a
        Recommendation. In this Process Document, the term "erratum" (plural
        "errata") refers to any class of mistake, from mere editorial to a
        serious error that may affect the conformance with the Recommendation by
        software or content (e.g., content validity).</p>
      <p>Working Groups <em class="rfc2119">must</em> track errata on an
        "errata page." An errata page is a list of enumerated errors, possibly
        accompanied by corrections. Each Recommendation links to an errata page;
        see the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication
          Rules</a>.</p>
      <p>A correction is first "proposed" by the Working Group. A correction
        becomes part of the Recommendation by the process for Revising a
        Recommendation described in the next section.</p>
      <p>A Working Group <em class="rfc2119">should</em> keep their errata
        pages up-to-date, as errors are reported by readers and implementers. A
        Working Group <em class="rfc2119">must</em> report errata page changes
        to interested parties, notably when corrections are proposed or
        incorporated into an Edited Recommendation, according to the Team's
        requirements.</p>
      <h4 id="revised-rec">7.7.2 Revising a Recommendation</h4>
      <p>A Working group <em class="rfc2119">may</em> request republication of
        a Recommendation, or W3C <em class="rfc2119">may</em> republish a

      <h2>8 <a id="ReviewAppeal">Advisory Committee Reviews, Appeals, and Votes</a></h2>
      <p>This section describes how the Advisory Committee reviews proposals
        from the Director and how Advisory Committee representatives appeal W3C
        decisions and decisions by the Director. A <a id="def-w3c-decision">W3C
          decision</a> is one where the Director (or the Director's delegate)
        has exercised the role of assessing consensus after an <a href="#ACReview">Advisory
          Committee review</a> of an <a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity
          Proposal</a>, after a <a href="#cfr">Call for Review of a Proposed
          Recommendation</a>, after a <a href="#cfr-edited">Call for Review of
          a Proposed Recommendation</a>, after a <a href="#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal
          to Rescind a W3C Recommendation</a>, and after a <a href="#GAProcess">Proposed

          Document</a> review.</p>
      <h3>8.1 <a id="ACReview">Advisory Committee Reviews</a></h3>
      <p>The Advisory Committee reviews:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>proposals for <a href="#ActivityCreation">new</a>, <a href="#ActivityModification">modified</a>,
          and <a href="#ActivityExtension">extended Activities</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="#CharterReview">new and modified Working and Interest
            Groups</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="#cfr">Proposed Recommendations</a>, <a href="#cfr-edited">Proposed
            Edited Recommendations</a>, <a href="#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal
            to Rescind a Recommendation</a>, and</li>
        <li><a href="#GAProcess">Proposed changes to the W3C process</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>8.1.1 <a id="ACReviewStart">Start of a Review Period</a></h4>
      <p>Each Advisory Committee review period begins with a Call for Review
        from the Team to the Advisory Committee. The <a id="reviewform">review
          form</a> describes the proposal, raises attention to deadlines,
        estimates when the decision will be available, and includes other
        practical information. Each Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        send one review, which <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be returned by
        its Advisory Committee representative.</p>
      <p>The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> provide two channels for
        Advisory Committee review comments:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>an archived <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a> channel; this is the
          default channel for reviews.</li>
        <li>an archived <a href="#Member-only">Member-only</a> channel.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Reviewers <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> send information to either
        or both channels. They <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also share
        their reviews with other Members on the <a href="#ACCommunication">Advisory
          Committee discussion list</a>.</p>
      <p>A Member organization <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> modify its
        review during a review period (e.g., in light of comments from other
        Members).</p>
      <h4>8.1.2 <a id="ACReviewAfter">After the Review Period</a></h4>
      <p>After the review period, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        announce to the Advisory Committee the level of support for the proposal
        (<a href="#def-Consensus">consensus</a> or <a href="#def-Dissent">dissent</a>).
        The Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> also indicate whether
        there were any Formal Objections, with attention to <a href="#confidentiality-change">changing
          confidentiality level</a>. This <a href="#def-w3c-decision">W3C
          decision</a> is generally one of the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The proposal is approved, possibly with minor changes integrated.</li>
        <li>The proposal is approved, possibly with <a href="#substantive-change">substantive
            changes</a> integrated. In this case the Director's announcement <span
            class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include rationale for the decision to
          advance the document despite the proposal for a substantive change.</li>
        <li>The proposal is returned for additional work, with a request to the
          initiator to <a href="#formal-address">formally address</a> certain
          issues.</li>
        <li>The proposal is rejected.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This document does not specify time intervals between the end of an
        Advisory Committee review period and the <a href="#def-w3c-decision">W3C
          decision</a>. This is to ensure that the Members and Team have
        sufficient time to consider comments gathered during the review. The
        Advisory Committee <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> expect an
        announcement sooner than <span class="time-interval">two weeks</span>
        after the end of a Proposed Recommendation review period. If, after <span
          class="time-interval">three weeks</span>, the Director has not
        announced the outcome, the Director <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        provide the Advisory Committee with an update.</p>
      <h3>8.2 <a id="ACAppeal">Appeal by Advisory Committee Representatives</a></h3>
      <p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        appeal certain decisions, though appeals are only expected to occur in
        extraordinary circumstances.</p>
      <p>When Advisory Committee review immediately precedes a decision,
        Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        only appeal when there is <a href="#def-Dissent">dissent</a>. These
        decisions are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#rec-publication">Publication of a Recommendation</a> or <a
            href="#proposed-rescinded-rec">Publication of a Rescinded
            Recommendation</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="#ActivityProposal">Activity creation</a>, <a href="#ActivityModification">modification</a>,
          or <a href="#ActivityExtension">extension</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="#cfp">Working or Interest Group creation</a> or <a href="#charter-extension">extension</a>,</li>
        <li>Changes to the <a href="#GAProcess">W3C process</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        always appeal the following decisions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#ActivityTermination">Activity closure</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="#charter-extension">Working or Interest Group extension</a>
          or <a href="#GeneralTermination">closure</a>,</li>
        <li><a href="#candidate-rec">Call for Implementations</a>, <a href="#cfr">Call
            for Review of a Proposed Recommendation</a>, <a href="#cfr-edited">Call
            for Review of an Edited Recommendation</a>, or <a href="#proposed-rescinded-rec">Proposal
            to Rescind a Recommendation</a></li>
        <li>the Director's intention to sign a <a href="#mou">Memorandum of
            Understanding</a> with another organization.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In all cases, an appeal <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be initiated
        within <span class="time-interval">three weeks</span> of the decision.</p>
      <p>An Advisory Committee representative initiates an appeal by sending a
        request to the Team (explained in detail in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Member/Intro">New
          Member Orientation</a>). The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        announce the appeal process to the Advisory Committee and provide an
        address for comments from Advisory Committee representatives. The
        archive of these comments <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be
        Member-visible. If, within <span class="time-interval">one week</span>
        of the Team's announcement, 5% or more of the Advisory Committee support
        the appeal request, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> organize
        an appeal vote asking the Advisory Committee to approve or reject the
        decision.
        <!-- Voting procedure to be determined --></p>
      <h3>8.3 <a id="ACVotes">Advisory Committee Votes</a></h3>
      <p>The Advisory Committee votes in <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">elections
          for seats on the TAG or Advisory Board</a>, and in the event of a
        formal appeal of a <a href="#def-w3c-decision">W3C decision</a>.
        Whenever the Advisory Committee votes, each Member or group of <a href="#MemberRelated">related
          Members</a> has one vote. In the case of <a href="#AB-TAG-elections">Advisory
          Board and TAG elections</a>, "one vote" means "one vote per available
        seat".</p>
      <h2>9 <a id="GAEvents">Workshops and Symposia</a></h2>
      <p>The Team organizes <a id="EventsW">Workshops</a> and <a id="EventsS">Symposia</a>
        to promote early involvement in the development of W3C Activities from
        Members and the public.</p>
      <p>The goal of a Workshop is usually either to convene experts and other
        interested parties for an exchange of ideas about a technology or
        policy, or to address the pressing concerns of W3C Members. Organizers
        of the first type of Workshop <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> solicit
        position papers for the Workshop program and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        use those papers to choose attendees and/or presenters.</p>
      <p>The goal of a Symposium is usually to educate interested parties about
        a particular subject.</p>
      <p>The Call for Participation in a Workshop or Symposium <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        indicate participation requirements or limits, and expected deliverables
        (e.g., reports and minutes). Organization of an event does not guarantee
        further investment by W3C in a particular topic, but <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        lead to proposals for new Activities or groups.</p>
      <p>Workshops and Symposia generally last one to three days. If a Workshop
        is being organized to address the pressing concerns of Members, the Team
        <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue the Call for Participation no
        later than <span class="time-interval">six weeks</span> prior to the
        Workshop's scheduled start date. For other Workshops and Symposia, the
        Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue a Call for Participation
        no later than <span class="time-interval">eight weeks</span> prior to
        the meeting's scheduled start date. This helps ensure that speakers and
        authors have adequate time to prepare position papers and talks.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> In general, W3C does not organize <a id="EventsC">conferences</a>.
        Currently, W3C presents its work to the public at the annual World Wide
        Web Conference, which is coordinated by the <a href="http://www.iw3c2.org/">International
          World Wide Web Conference Committee</a> (<abbr>IW3C2</abbr>).</p>
      <h2>10 <a id="Liaisons">Liaisons</a></h2>
      <p>W3C uses the term "liaison" to refer to coordination of activities with
        a variety of organizations, through a number of mechanisms ranging from
        very informal (e.g., an individual from another organization
        participates in a W3C Working Group, or just follows its work) to mutual
        membership, to even more formal agreements. Liaisons are not meant to
        substitute for W3C membership.</p>
      <p>All liaisons <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> be coordinated by the
        Team due to requirements for public communication; patent, copyright,
        and other IPR policies; confidentiality agreements; and mutual
        membership agreements.</p>
      <p>The W3C Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> negotiate and sign a
        <a id="mou">Memorandum of Understanding (<abbr>MoU</abbr>)</a> with
        another organization. Before signing the MoU, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        inform the Advisory Committee of the intent to sign and make the MoU
        available for Advisory Committee review; the Advisory Committee <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        <a href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a>. Once approved, a Memorandum of
        Understanding <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> be made public.</p>
      <p>Information about <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/11/StdLiaison">W3C
          liaisons with other organizations</a> and the guidelines W3C follows
        when creating a liaison [<a href="#ref-liaison-list">PUB28</a>] is
        available on the Web.</p>
      <h2>11 <a id="Submission">Member Submission Process</a></h2>
      <p>The Member Submission process allows Members to propose technology or
        other ideas for consideration by the Team. After review, the Team <span
          class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the material at the W3C Web site.
        The formal process affords Members a record of their contribution and
        gives them a mechanism for disclosing the details of the transaction
        with the Team (including IPR claims). The Team also publishes review
        comments on the Submitted materials for W3C Members, the public, and the
        media.</p>
      <p>A <a id="MemberSubmission">Member Submission</a> consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One or more documents developed outside of the W3C process, and</li>
        <li>Information about the documents, provided by the Submitter.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One or more Members (called the "Submitter(s)") <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        participate in a Member Submission. Only W3C Members <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        be listed as Submitter(s).</p>
      <p>The Submission process consists of the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>One of the Submitter(s) sends a request to the Team to acknowledge
          the Submission request. The Team and Submitter(s) communicate to
          ensure that the Member Submission is complete.</li>
        <li>After Team review, the Director <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
          either acknowledge or reject the Submission request.
          <ul>
            <li>If <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledged</a>, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
              publish the Member Submission at the public W3C Web site, in
              addition to Team comments about the Member Submission.</li>
            <li>If <a href="#SubmissionNo">rejected</a>, the Submitter(s) <span
                class="rfc2119">MAY</span> appeal to either the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a>
              or the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid confusion about the Member Submission
        process, please note that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Documents in a Member Submission are developed outside of W3C. These
          documents are <strong>not</strong> part of the <a href="#Reports">technical
            report development process</a> (and therefore are not included in
          the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/">index of W3C technical reports</a>).
          Members wishing to have documents developed outside of W3C published
          by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> follow the Member Submission
          process.</li>
        <li>The Submission process is <strong>not</strong> a means by which
          Members ask for "ratification" of these documents as <a href="#RecsW3C">W3C
            Recommendations</a>.</li>
        <li>There is no requirement or guarantee that technology which is part
          of an acknowledged Submission request will receive further
          consideration by W3C (e.g., by a W3C Working Group).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Publication of a Member Submission by W3C does not imply endorsement by
        W3C, including the W3C Team or Members. The acknowledgment of a
        Submission request does not imply that any action will be taken by W3C.
        It merely records publicly that the Submission request has been made by
        the Submitter. A Member Submission published by W3C <span class="rfc2119">MUST
          NOT</span> be referred to as "work in progress" of the W3C.</p>
      <p>The list of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/">acknowledged
          Member Submissions</a> [<a href="#ref-submission-list">PUB10</a>] is
        available at the W3C Web site.</p>
      <h3>11.1 <a id="SubmissionRights">Submitter Rights and Obligations</a></h3>
      <p>When more than one Member jointly participates in a Submission request,
        only one Member formally sends in the request. That Member <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        copy each of the Advisory Committee representatives of the other
        participating Members, and each of those Advisory Committee
        representatives <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> confirm (by email to
        the Team) their participation in the Submission request.</p>
      <p>At any time prior to acknowledgment, any Submitter <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        withdraw support for a Submission request (described in "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How
          to send a Submission request</a>"). A Submission request is
        "withdrawn" when no Submitter(s) support it. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST
          NOT</span> make statements about withdrawn Submission requests.</p>
      <p>Prior to acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST
          NOT</span>, <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, refer to a
        document as "submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium" or "under
        consideration by W3C" or any similar phrase either in public or Member
        communication. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span>
        imply in public or Member communication that W3C is working (with the
        Submitter(s)) on the material in the Member Submission. The Submitter(s)
        <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> publish the documents in the Member
        Submission prior to acknowledgment (without reference to the Submission
        request).</p>
      <p>After acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span>,
        <strong>under any circumstances</strong>, imply W3C investment in the
        Member Submission until, and unless, the material has been adopted as
        part of a W3C <a href="#def-Activity">Activity</a>.</p>
      <h4>11.1.1 <a id="SubmissionScope">Scope of Member Submissions</a></h4>
      <p>When a technology overlaps in scope with the work of a chartered
        Working Group, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> <a href="#group-participation">participate
          in the Working Group</a> and contribute the technology to the group's
        process rather than seek publication through the Member Submission
        process. The Working Group <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> incorporate
        the contributed technology into its deliverables. If the Working Group
        does not incorporate the technology, it <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD
          NOT</span> publish the contributed documents as Working Group Notes
        since Working Group Notes represent group output, not input to the
        group.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, while W3C is in the early stages of developing an
        Activity Proposal or charter, Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span>
        use the Submission process to build consensus around concrete proposals
        for new work.</p>
      <p>Members <span class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</span> submit materials
        covering topics well outside the scope of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">W3C's
          mission</a> [<a href="#ref-mission">PUB15</a>].</p>
      <h4>11.1.2 <a id="SubmissionReqs">Information Required in a Submission
          Request</a></h4>
      <p>The Submitter(s) and any other authors of the submitted material <span
          class="rfc2119">MUST</span> agree that, if the request is
        acknowledged, the documents in the Member Submission will be subject to
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">W3C
          Document License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>] and will
        include a reference to it. The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        hold the copyright for the documents in a Member Submission.</p>
      <p>The request must satisfy the Member Submission licensing commitments of
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy#sec-submissions">section
          3.3</a> of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">W3C

      <p>The Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> include the
        following information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The list of all submitting Members.</li>
        <li>Position statements from all submitting Members (gathered by the
          Submitter). All position statements must appear in a separate
          document.</li>
        <li>Complete electronic copies of any documents submitted for
          consideration (e.g., a technical specification, a position paper,
          etc.) If the Submission request is acknowledged, these documents will
          be published by W3C and therefore must satisfy the Communication
          Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication Rules</a>

      <p>The request <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> also answer the

      <ul>
        <li>What proprietary technology is required to implement the areas

        <li>What action would the Submitter like W3C to take if the Submission
          request is acknowledged?</li>
        <li>What mechanisms are there to make changes to the specification being
          submitted? This includes, but is not limited to, stating where change
          control will reside if the request is acknowledged.</li>

      <p>For other administrative requirements related to Submission requests,
        see "<a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/submission">How to send a

      <h3>11.2 <a id="TeamSubmissionRights">Team Rights and Obligations</a></h3>
      <p>Although they are not technical reports, the documents in a Member
        Submission <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> fulfill the requirements
        established by the Team, including the Team's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/pubrules">Publication
          Rules</a>.</p>
      <p>The Team sends a <a id="validation-notice">validation notice</a> to
        the Submitter(s) once the Team has reviewed a Submission request and
        judged it complete and correct.</p>
      <p>Prior to a decision to <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledge</a> or <a
          href="#SubmissionNo">reject</a> the request, the request is <a href="#Team-only">Team-only</a>,
        and the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> hold it in the strictest
        confidentiality. In particular, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span>
        comment to the media about the Submission request.</p>
      <h3>11.3 <a id="SubmissionYes">Acknowledgment of a Submission Request</a></h3>
      <p>The Director <a href="#SubmissionYes">acknowledges</a> a Submission
        request by sending an announcement to the Advisory Committee. Though the
        announcement <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> be made at any time, the
        Submitter(s) can expect an announcement between <span class="time-interval">four
          to six weeks</span> after the <a href="#validation-notice">validation
          notice</a>. The Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> keep the
        Submitter(s) informed of when an announcement is likely to be made.</p>
      <p>Once a Submission request has been acknowledged, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Publish the Member Submission.</li>
        <li>Publish Team comments about the Submission request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the Submitter(s) wishes to modify a document published as the result
        of acknowledgment, the Submitter(s) <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        start the Submission process from the beginning, even just to correct
        editorial changes.</p>
      <h3>11.4 <a id="SubmissionNo">Rejection of a Submission Request</a></h3>
      <p>The Director <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> reject a Submission
        request for a variety of reasons, including any of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ideas expressed in the request overlap in scope with the work of
          a chartered Working Group, and acknowledgment might jeopardize the
          progress of the group.</li>
        <li>The IPR statement made by the Submitter(s) is inconsistent with the
          W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy">Patent
            Policy</a> [<a href="#ref-patentpolicy">PUB33</a>], <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents">Document
            License</a> [<a href="#ref-doc-license">PUB18</a>], or other IPR
          policies.</li>
        <li>The ideas expressed in the request are poor, might harm the Web, or
          run counter to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission">W3C's
            mission</a>.</li>
        <li>The ideas expressed in the request lie well outside the scope of
          W3C's mission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In case of a rejection, the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        inform the Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitter(s). If
        requested by the Submitter(s), the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span>
        provide rationale to the Submitter(s) about the rejection. Other than to
        the Submitter(s), the Team <span class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</span> make
        statements about why a Submission request was rejected.</p>
      <p>The Advisory Committee representative(s) of the Submitters(s) <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span>
        appeal the rejection to the <a href="#TAG">TAG</a> if the reasons are
        related to Web architecture, or to the <a href="#AB">Advisory Board</a>
        if the request is rejected for other reasons. In this case the Team <span
          class="rfc2119">SHOULD</span> make available its rationale for the
        rejection to the appropriate body. The Team will establish a process for
        such appeals that ensures the appropriate <a href="#confidentiality-levels">level
          of confidentiality</a>.</p>
      <h2>12 <a id="GAProcess">Process Evolution</a></h2>
      <p>The <a id="ProcessDoc">W3C Process Document</a> undergoes similar
        consensus-building processes as technical reports, with the <a href="#AB">Advisory
          Board</a> acting as the sponsoring Working Group.</p>
      <p>The Advisory Board initiates review of a Process Document as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The Team sends a Call for Review to the Advisory Committee and other
          W3C groups.</li>
        <li>After comments have been <a href="#formal-address">formally
            addressed</a> and the document possibly modified, the Team seeks
          endorsement from the Members by initiating an <a href="#ACReview">Advisory
            Committee review</a> of a Proposed Process Document. The review
          period <span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> last at least <span class="time-interval">four
            weeks</span>.</li>
        <li><a href="#ACReviewAfter">After the Advisory Committee review</a>, if
          there is consensus, the Team enacts the new process officially by
          announcing the <a href="#def-w3c-decision">W3C decision</a> to the
          Advisory Committee. If there was <a href="#def-Dissent">dissent</a>,
          Advisory Committee representatives <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> <a
            href="#ACAppeal">appeal</a> the decision.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>W3C <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> also modify a Process Document by
        following the processes for <a href="#rec-modify">modifying a
          Recommendation</a>.</p>
