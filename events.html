<p>The Team organizes <a name="EventsW" id="EventsW">Workshops</a> and <a name=
"EventsS" id="EventsS">Symposia</a> to promote early involvement in the
development of W3C Activities from Members and the public.</p>
<p>The goal of a Workshop is usually either to convene experts and other
interested parties for an exchange of ideas about a technology or policy, or to
address the pressing concerns of W3C Members. Organizers of the first type of
Workshop <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> solicit position papers for the
Workshop program and <span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> use those papers to
choose attendees and/or presenters.</p>
<p>The goal of a Symposium is usually to educate interested parties about a
particular subject.</p>
<p>The Call for Participation in a Workshop or Symposium <span class=
"rfc2119">MAY</span> indicate participation requirements or limits, and
expected deliverables (e.g., reports and minutes). Organization of an event
does not guarantee further investment by W3C in a particular topic, but
<span class="rfc2119">MAY</span> lead to proposals for new Activities or
groups.</p>
<p>Workshops and Symposia generally last one to three days. If a Workshop is
being organized to address the pressing concerns of Members, the Team
<span class="rfc2119">MUST</span> issue the Call for Participation no later
than <span class="time-interval">six weeks</span> prior to the Workshop's
scheduled start date. For other Workshops and Symposia, the Team <span class=
"rfc2119">MUST</span> issue a Call for Participation no later than <span class=
"time-interval">eight weeks</span> prior to the meeting's scheduled start date.
This helps ensure that speakers and authors have adequate time to prepare
position papers and talks.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In general, W3C does not organize <a name="EventsC"
id="EventsC">conferences</a>. Currently, W3C presents its work to the public at
the annual World Wide Web Conference, which is coordinated by the <a href=
"http://www.iw3c2.org/">International World Wide Web Conference Committee</a>
(<acronym>IW3C2</acronym>).</p>
